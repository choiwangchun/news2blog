What is the Project 2025 and why President Biden is so vocal about it,"President Joe Biden said in Michigan described 'Project 2025' as a harbinger of a ""nightmare"" for the country should his Republican adversary be elected and enact the policies outlined in the document.
“Folks, Project 2025 is the biggest attack on our system of government and on our personal freedom that’s ever been proposed in the history of this country,” Biden baid.
According to him, this imitative “is run and paid for by Trump people” and is “a blueprint for a second Trump.”
What is the Project 2025
Project 2025, a comprehensive 900-page policy document authored by Trump allies and former officials, including Paul Dans and Spencer Chretien, aims to dismantle significant portions of the U.S. government and instate federal workers aligned with Trump's ideology.
The roadmap, orchestrated by the Heritage Foundation and supported by numerous conservative organizations, also proposes a dramatic tax code overhaul and the implementation of abortion restrictions.
The president is leveraging Project 2025 as a tool to consolidate the Democratic Party, which has shown signs of division regarding his continued participation in the race, especially after a debate performance that has been perceived by some as detrimental to his reelection chances.
Nevertheless, many Democratic voters at the rally expressed their support for Biden and their discontent with the internal party pressure for him to step aside.
Biden's campaign is expected to maintain its focus on Project 2025 during the upcoming GOP convention, signaling the administration's strategy to unite Democrats against the potential of a Trump return to the White House.
Trump distances himself from Project 2025 
Former President Donald Trump distanced himself from Project 2025. In a recent post on social media, Trump stated that he has no knowledge of the project, which is gaining attention due to its association with his administration.
CNN reported that numerous former Trump administration officials were involved in the creation of Project 2025. Six former Cabinet secretaries, four ambassador nominees, and key figures from Trump's immigration policy team are among those who contributed to the document.
The involvement of Trump's first deputy chief of staff in the project has been highlighted, with approximately 20 pages of the document credited to him.
Overall, a CNN review found that at least 140 individuals who served under the Trump administration participated in the development of Project 2025.

"'I promise you I’m okay', Biden tells his supporters in Michigan","President Joe Biden made a staunch declaration of his intention to run for re-election at a Michigan rally, amidst increasing pressure from within his own party to step aside.
Amid chants of support from a crowd, Biden delivered a vehement defense of his candidacy and criticized former President Donald Trump, who he accused of receiving undue leniency from the media.
Biden pointed out his previous success against Trump, saying, ""I'm the only Democrat or Republican who has beaten Donald Trump ever. And I'm going to beat him again.""
“That’s why I’m running to finish this job. There’s more to do. I know I’m only 41,” Biden said. “I promise you I’m okay.”
Despite recent Democratic debates that showcased Biden's verbal missteps and a subsequent poll by NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist indicating an unchanged presidential race, Biden expressed confidence in his ability to win. 
He also harshly criticized the ""right-wing Project 2025"" during a rally in the key electoral state of Michigan, using the controversial initiative as a focal point to address Democratic concerns about his candidacy in the upcoming presidential race.
Biden characterized Project 2025 as the most significant threat to the U.S. government and personal freedoms in the nation's history, attributing its origins to supporters of former President Donald Trump and describing it as a ""blueprint for a second Trump.""
Amidst energetic chants of support from attendees, Biden dismissed rumors of his withdrawal from the presidential race, emphatically stating his intention to run and win.
“I am running, and we’re going to win!” Biden said.
Biden's firm stance comes as several Democratic lawmakers have publicly urged him to reconsider his candidacy. Representatives Brittany Pettersen (D-Colo.) and Mike Levin (D-Calif.) are the latest to join the call for Biden to pass the torch, with a total of 21 House Democrats and Senator Peter Welch of Vermont expressing similar sentiments.
The internal party debate over Biden's candidacy was further highlighted by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), who met with Biden to discuss the election and relay concerns from fellow Democrats.",https://www.investing.com/news/politics/i-promise-you-im-okay-biden-tells-his-supporters-in-michigan-3518130
Elon Musk has donated 'a significant amount' to Trump-linked SPAC- report,"Ken Griffin and Paul Singer, two influential Republican billionaires known for their past criticism of Donald Trump, have been in discussions with the former president about potentially supporting his bid to return to the White House, according to Bloomberg News. 
Elon Musk has reportedly donated a significant amount of funds to a Trump-focused super political action committee (SPAC).
After Stephen King recently called for Biden not to run for re-election, Musk responded on X that ""[e]ven Stephen King is voting for Trump!""
On the other hand, Griffin, the founder of Citadel, met with Trump at the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia two weeks ago, according to Bloomberg News.
Singer, who founded Elliott Investment Management, has also had a separate meeting with Trump in recent times.
These meetings come as Trump's campaign has been gaining momentum due to a recent influx of contributions following his felony conviction and perceived missteps by President Joe Biden.
Neither Griffin nor Singer has previously donated to Trump's presidential campaigns, despite being among the GOP's most substantial donors. Their potential support would mark a notable change, as both have been openly critical of Trump in the past.
Singer had expressed concerns in 2016 that Trump's trade policies could lead to a ""global depression,"" and Griffin referred to Trump as a ""three-time loser"" in 2022, following a disappointing performance by Republicans in the midterm elections.
The financial backing of Griffin and Singer could provide a significant boost to Trump's campaign. Griffin has donated $233 million to federal elections since 2015, while Singer has contributed $89 million, Bloomberg News wrote, citing OpenSecrets' data.
Both have supported various super political action committees and candidates, including a $5 million donation each to a super PAC allied with former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.
The decision of these hedge fund managers to support Trump's 2024 campaign is still pending, with Griffin indicating that his decision would be influenced by Trump's choice of a running mate.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/elon-musk-has-donated-a-significant-amount-to-trumplinked-spac-report-3518123
Q2 earnings season preview: What to expect from corporate America,"In a Tuesday note to clients, Bank of America strategists previewed the imminent Q2 earnings season as investors brace for a new series of results following a solid Q1.
In the first quarter, Corporate America managed to deliver a strong earnings beat, with earnings per share (EPS) surpassing consensus estimates by 3%. This was achieved against a backdrop of an easier year-over-year comparison, reflecting a decline of 6% in Q2 2023 compared to a 3% decline in Q1 2023.
BofA strategists said they expect a 2% beat in Q2, which would be “in line with the historical average and the smallest since 4Q22.” 
Despite a strong start, macroeconomic conditions have weakened since Q1. The Economic Surprise Index (ESI) has reached its lowest level since June 2015, indicating a potential 3% miss in Q2 earnings. However, historical data provides some optimism: post-global financial crisis, EPS have beaten expectations 91% of the time when the ESI was negative, averaging a 3% beat. 
“An EPS miss is rare,” strategists highlighted.
BofA’s Q2 preview indicates that while economic indicators may suggest a weaker quarter, analysts have maintained their earnings estimates since March. This is a significant departure from the typical trend where estimates are cut by 4% on average into earnings, implying that analysts are confident in their forecasts. 
“Both our earnings revision ratio & guidance ratio improved in 2Q, and Bofa indicators suggest growth is holding up. Conversely, we estimate FX was a 100bp headwind to sales, the biggest hit since 1Q23,” strategists noted.
One significant factor to watch this earnings season is the anticipated shift in growth dynamics, according to BofA’s team. Q2 is expected to mark the first quarter of EPS growth for the ""Other 493"" companies in the S&P 500, excluding the Magnificent 7, since Q4 2022. In contrast, growth for the Magnificent 7 is expected to slow for the second consecutive quarter and continue to decelerate into Q3. 
“Growth is broadening out and so should the market,” strategists remarked.
BofA also highlights that while demand is the primary driver of earnings, inflation is a lagging indicator. The good news is that the anticipated demand recovery for the second half of the year isn't overly optimistic. 
Excluding the Magnificent 7, consensus expects just a 1% real sales growth in the second half. This modest expectation is supported by the end of the de-stocking cycle, which has been one of the sharpest in history. The ratio of new orders to inventories has improved, suggesting that the inventory correction phase is nearing its end.
“While the 14% EPS growth expected in 4Q looks high, over 60% of growth comes from the Mag. 7, non-recurring expenses in Health Care from last year, and Financials,” BofA’s note adds.
Lastly, BofA pointed out that the upcoming earnings season should also provide new insights into the impact of AI investments. 
While monetization of AI is likely to take longer than initially hoped, major tech companies continue to invest aggressively. Consensus expects a 34% increase in capital expenditure (capex) from hyperscalers in 2024, totaling around $200 billion. 
“The key question is whether they will continue to invest aggressively even if monetization is pushed out. For now, there are no signs of slowing investments, and we believe we’re in the early innings of an AI investment cycle,” strategists said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/q2-earnings-season-preview-what-to-expect-from-corporate-america-432SI-3518122
Boeing begins 777-9 certification flight trials with US FAA,"By Chandni Shah and Devika Madhusudhanan Nair
(Reuters) -Boeing has started certification flight testing of its long-delayed 777-9 with U.S. aviation regulators onboard, the U.S. planemaker said in an emailed statement. 
The company said it conducted its first flight on Friday night after receiving Type Inspection Authorization (TIA). 
The development is a boost for Boeing (NYSE:BA), which has been grappling with production and legal issues since a Jan. 5 mid-air panel blowout on a 737 MAX plane. 
The news was first reported by Air Current. 
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) while declining to comment on specific certification projects, said ""Generally, this kind of thorough process takes many months.""
The 777-9 is part of the 777X project to upgrade the 777 wide-body jet. The project has been in development since 2013 but has faced multiple hold-ups, including certification delays.
Type inspection authorization is typically associated with the start of the certification process, made after the FAA has examined technical data. The milestone allows FAA pilots to participate in flight testing needed to certify the plane for normal operation. 
The chairman of Emirates, the plane's biggest customer, said in May he did not expect the certification before the first quarter of 2025. 
Boeing has said that the 777-9 test fleet will undergo the most thorough commercial flight test effort the planemaker has ever undertaken.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/boeing-begins-777x-certification-flight-trials-with-us-faa-air-current-says-3518119
Bank reserves are still ample — but for how much longer?,"Barclays analysts caution that while bank reserves remain ample, their abundance may not last much longer. Barclays' analysis indicates that the transition to a steeper part of the reserve demand curve, where rates start moving higher, could occur when reserves reach around $3.1 trillion. 
The analysts anticipate that quantitative tightening (QT) will conclude in December.
Currently, Barclays says reserves are not scarce, as evidenced by the stable FF-IORB spread, which has remained at -7 basis points since the Federal Reserve's rate hike began. 
However, the bank notes that this spread may soon begin to narrow. ""Banks' reserve demand curve is nonlinear, and the sensitivity of the FF-IORB spread to changes in the level of reserves increases as these balances shrink,"" the note states.
Barclays highlights the importance of monitoring changes in the slope of the reserve demand curve, or the demand elasticity of the funds rate, to determine the shift from abundant to scarce reserves. 
According to their models, banks are nearing the steeper part of this curve, which is estimated to be around $3.1 trillion in reserves, assuming reverse repurchase agreement (RRP) balances are near zero.
They note the Fed faces uncertainty regarding the pace at which QT will push banks into this steeply sloping part of the demand curve. 
Barclays points out that the reserve demand curve may have shifted, meaning banks might want to hold more reserves at every level of the FF-IORB spread. In response to these uncertainties, the Fed has begun tapering Treasury roll-offs, signaling a cautious approach.
Barclays concludes, ""There are currently no signs of reserve scarcity,"" as indicated by the flat and still negative FF-IORB spread and other market indicators. However, the analysts warn that this situation could change, emphasizing the need for close monitoring as the year progresses.'",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bank-reserves-are-still-ample--but-for-how-much-longer-432SI-3518132
"Geopolitics, AI, election: UBS answers 10 key investors questions","In a note to clients this week, analysts at UBS addressed a range of investor concerns, offering insights into navigating a complex market landscape.
Geopolitical Risks and Portfolio Resilience: While geopolitical tensions persist, UBS cautions against reactive portfolio shifts. Instead, investors should focus on building resilient portfolios through hedging, structured strategies, and alternative investments.
Cash Management and Interest Rates: As central banks contemplate rate cuts, UBS says investors should optimize cash holdings. Bond laddering and structured investment strategies are suggested to capture attractive yields while managing liquidity.
Equity Market Outlook: Despite market highs, UBS remains bullish on equities, citing robust economic growth, potential interest rate cuts, and the AI boom as supportive factors. A focus on quality growth stocks, especially in the US tech sector, is recommended.
Tech Investment Strategy: The AI revolution is driving capital expenditure across industries. UBS favors large-cap tech companies for their strong balance sheets and growth prospects. However, they explain that investors should also explore opportunities in sectors undergoing technological disruption.
Fixed Income Opportunities: With attractive yields and a potential rate-cutting cycle, UBS recommends a diversified fixed income approach, combining core bond holdings with higher-yielding segments.
Navigating the US Election: Given the uncertainty surrounding the US election, UBS advises caution and suggests hedging strategies to manage potential market volatility.
Building a Balanced Portfolio: To weather market fluctuations, UBS emphasizes the importance of a balanced portfolio, including alternative investments. They believe this approach can help protect wealth and capitalize on growth opportunities.
Renewable Energy Investments: While the bank notes that listed renewable energy investments have faced challenges, unlisted infrastructure options appear more promising. These investments offer potential diversification and inflation-linked returns, according to UBS.
Real Estate Market Outlook: After a challenging period, the real estate market may be turning a corner due to the potential for rate cuts, according to UBS. The bank feels that selective investment in quality assets is key.
Sustainable Investing: UBS sees strong momentum in sustainable investing, driven by favorable economic conditions, regulatory changes, and public spending. A diversified portfolio approach is recommended, with a focus on themes like industrial transition, water, food, and agriculture.

What should investors do with tech stocks after a 21.5% H1 rally?,"Tech stocks rally, which is largely driven by gains in semiconductor and computer hardware sectors benefiting from AI advancements, has outpaced the broader market by a significant margin in the first half of the calendar year.
Tech stocks have surged 21.5% in the first half of 2024, and now present both opportunities and challenges for investors, as per Bernstein Private Wealth Management’s note published on Monday.
While the tech sector has recorded impressive gains, its performance has been highly concentrated, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) alone accounting for a substantial portion of the outperformance.
Only 30% of tech stocks have outperformed, marking the lowest figure since 2002, said Bernstein, adding that the concentration clearly points out the narrow nature of the tech rally.
At the same time, valuation concerns loom large as well. Tech stocks are currently trading at a 49% premium to the market, nearing levels seen during the dot-com bubble, and well above historical averages, noted Bernstein.
Bernstein also pointed out that while tech's expected growth premium remains higher than historical norms, driven particularly by the semiconductor sector, elevated valuations pose risks, especially considering the potential for an AI digestion period and ongoing uncertainties in global markets.
However, the momentum in tech is receiving continuous support with expectations of rising AI adoption and potential economic recovery.
Lower anticipated interest rates could further buoy growth stocks, including tech, though the risk of overvaluation persists, as per Bernstein.
Bernstein recommended that investment strategies going forward should focus on a balanced approach, adding that investors should maintain a market-weight allocation to tech.
It also suggested investors adopt a barbell strategy between growth and value-oriented tech stocks. Opportunities may also lie in selectively investing in SMID cap names where valuations are more attractive and performance has lagged behind, it added.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/what-should-investors-do-with-tech-stocks-after-a-215-h1-rally-3518117
The Democratic dilemma: Biden faces more calls to step aside,"A rising number of Democratic lawmakers are urging President Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race as they believe that a younger candidate might be better suited to confront the challenges ahead. 
The calls for Biden's withdrawal intensified following Biden's solo press conference after the NATO summit, with at least three additional House Democrats voicing their concerns.
Despite optimism from Biden's team about his performance, doubts persist within the party. Many worry whether Biden still possesses the vigor required to defeat former President Donald Trump and effectively lead the nation for another term.
Statements of concern
Congressman Jim Himes acknowledged Biden as a remarkable leader but stressed the importance of presenting a strong candidate for the upcoming election. 
""The 2024 election will define the future of American democracy, and we must put forth the strongest candidate possible to confront the threat posed by Trump’s promised MAGA authoritarianism,"" said Himes. 
He expressed his belief that Biden is no longer that candidate and urged him to step aside.
Representative Scott Peters, (D.Calif), echoed these sentiments, referencing Biden's debate performance and declining swing state polls. ""Today I ask President Biden to withdraw from the presidential campaign. The stakes are high, and we are on a losing course,"" Peters said. 
At the same time, Representative Eric Sorensen, (D-Ill), facing re-election in a competitive district, also called for Biden to step aside. He expressed hope for a candidate who could communicate a positive vision for the country, urging Biden to prioritize the nation's interests over personal ambition.
Biden's response and party tensions
During the news conference, Biden reiterated his commitment to completing the job he was elected to do. He pointed out the gravity of the situation he inherited in terms of the economy, foreign policy, and domestic division. However, this did little to reassure his critics.
Some Democratic officials have been criticizing Biden's lack of a future-oriented message and his focus on foreign policy issues irrelevant to swing voters. ""He did not do anything to reassure Democrats that he understands how dire his political situation is or that he has a realistic plan to win,"" an official told CNBC on anonymity. 
As the presidential nominating conventions approach, time is running out for the Democratic Party to resolve its internal conflicts. Democratic leaders are raising the urgency as they believe that the week after next when lawmakers are back is the final make-or-break moment. 
To be sure, the first significant call for Biden to withdraw came from Representative Lloyd Doggett, a long-serving Texas congressman, just five days after the June 27 debate. Doggett praised Biden's achievements but showed concern over his ability to defend them effectively.
A chorus of dissent
Several other House Democrats have joined the chorus, including Representative Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz), Representative Seth Moulton, (D-Mass), Representative Angie Craig, (D-Minn), and Representative Adam Smith (D-Wash), among others. 
Grijalva described the campaign as ""precarious"" and called on Biden to take responsibility for holding the White House while Moulton, a former presidential candidate, expressed doubts about Biden's ability to defeat Trump. 
Craig, on the other hand, voiced concerns about Biden's debate performance and warned of a narrow window to choose a replacement while Smith doubted Biden's capacity to effectively communicate his case to the American people.
Other prominent Democrats like Representative Mikie Sherrill, Representative Pat Ryan, and Representative Earl Blumenauer have also urged Biden to step aside as they stressed the high stakes and the need to protect democracy.
Gaffes and health concerns
Biden's recent gaffes, including confusing Vice President Kamala Harris with Donald Trump and mistaking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for Russian President Vladimir Putin, have fueled criticism and raised questions about his age and clarity. 
These slip-ups have been widely ridiculed online and seized upon by Republicans to undermine his campaign. 
Health concerns have also been a focal point. Biden's personal doctor, Kevin O'Connor, recently addressed allegations of Parkinson’s disease following a lackluster debate performance. 
Furthermore, New York-based neurologist Dr. Tom Pitts suggested that Biden exhibits ""classic features of neurodegeneration"" based on his public appearances.
While some prominent Democrats have refrained from taking a definitive stance, others have expressed their doubts. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has publicly supported Biden but privately signaled openness to a replacement. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and current House Democratic Chief Hakeem Jeffries have remained noncommittal. 
Despite the growing opposition, Biden still has steadfast supporters. Vice President Kamala Harris and potential replacement candidates like California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and Maryland Governor Wes Moore have stood by him. The Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus have also reaffirmed their backing.
As the Democratic Party faces its internal struggles and the pressure mounts on Biden to step aside, the coming weeks will be crucial in determining the party's strategy for the 2024 election. With the stakes higher than ever, Democrats will want to present a unified front capable of securing victory.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/the-democratic-dilemma-biden-faces-more-calls-to-step-aside-3518126
Israel targets Hamas military chief; Gaza health officials say at least 71 killed,"By Nidal al-Mughrabi, Hatem Khaled and Maayan Lubell
CAIRO/GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) -An Israeli airstrike killed at least 71 Palestinians in a designated humanitarian zone in Gaza on Saturday, the enclave's health ministry said, in an attack that Israel said targeted Hamas' military chief Mohammed Deif. 
Hamas said in a statement that Israeli claims that it had targeted leaders of the group were false and aimed at justifying the attack. 
The Israeli military said that the strike against Deif also targeted Rafa Salama, the commander of Hamas' Khan Younis Brigade, describing them as two of the masterminds of the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the nine-month war in Gaza. 
Deif has survived seven Israeli assassination attempts, the most recent in 2021 and has topped Israel's most wanted list for decades, held responsible for the deaths of dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings. 
The Gaza health ministry said at least 71 Palestinians had been killed in the strike and 289 injured, the deadliest toll in weeks. 
Al-Mawasi is a designated humanitarian area to which the Israeli army has repeatedly urged Palestinians to head to after issuing evacuation orders from other areas.
The Israeli military published an aerial photo of the site, which Reuters was not immediately able to verify, where it said ""terrorists hid among civilians"". 
""The location of the strike was an open area surrounded by trees, several buildings, and sheds,"" it said in a statement. 
A military official told journalists in an online briefing the area was not a tent complex, but an operational compound run by Hamas and that several more militants were there, guarding Deif.
It was unclear whether Deif was killed. ""We are still checking and verifying the results of the strike,"" the military official said. 
Many of those wounded in the strike were taken to the nearby Nasser Hospital, which hospital officials said had been overwhelmed and was ""no longer able to function"" due to the intensity of the Israeli offensive and an acute shortage of medical supplies.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant was holding special consultations, his office said, in light of ""developments in Gaza"". It was unclear how the strike would affect ceasefire talks underway in Doha and Cairo. 
The Hamas-run media office said at least 100 people had been killed and wounded, including members of the Civil Emergency Service. 
A senior Hamas official did not confirm whether Deif had been present and called the Israeli allegations ""nonsense"".
""All the martyrs are civilians and what happened was a grave escalation of the war of genocide, backed by the American support and world silence,"" Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters, adding the strike showed Israel was not interested in reaching a ceasefire deal.
Separately, at least 10 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli attack on a prayer hall at a Gaza camp for displaced people West of Gaza City, Palestinian health officials said. 
ATTACK 'SURPRISING', SAY WITNESSES
Reuters footage showed ambulances racing towards the area amidst clouds of smoke and dust. Displaced people, including women and children, were fleeing in panic, some holding belongings in their hands.
Witnesses said the attack came as a surprise as the area had been calm, adding more than one missile had been fired. Some of the wounded who were being evacuated were rescue workers, they said.
""They're all gone, my whole family's gone.. where are my brothers? They're all gone, they're all gone. There's no one left,"" said one tearful woman, who did not give her name.
""Our children are in pieces, they are in pieces. Shame (on you),"" she added.
Rising up the Hamas ranks over 30 years, Deif developed the group's network of tunnels and its bomb-making expertise, Hamas sources say. 
In March, Israel said it killed Deif's deputy, Marwan Issa. Hamas has since neither confirmed, nor denied his death. 
Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages in a cross-border raid into southern Israel on Oct. 7, according to Israeli tallies.
Israel has retaliated by military action in Gaza that has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, medical authorities in Gaza say.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/israel-targets-hamas-military-chief-gaza-officials-say-at-least-71-killed-3518145
