"Boeing plea, Paramount merger, French election - what's moving markets","Investing.com -- Wall Street looks set to start the new week on a negative note, as investors await the release of key inflation data and testimony from Fed chief Jerome Powell. Paramount Global agrees to merge with Skydance, while Boeing has accepted guilt to a criminal charge, netting a hefty fine. 
1. Futures lower ahead of key inflation release
U.S. stock futures edged lower Monday, consolidating at the start of a week that includes key inflation data, testimony from Fed chief Jerome Powell and the start of the quarterly earnings reporting season. 
By 04:10 ET (08:10 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 10 points, or 0.1%, lower, S&P 500 futures dropped 4 points, or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 20 points, or 0.1%.
The broad-based S&P 500 index registered its fourth positive week in the last five last week, amid growing hopes that cooling inflation and a slowing economy could lead to a Federal Reserve interest rate cut later this year.
The June consumer price index, which will be released Thursday, and comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to both the Senate and House during the week, will be in focus as investors seek more clues over future monetary policy.
The week also sees the start of the new earnings season, with a number of major banks, including  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), set to release their results at the end of the week. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) are also set to post results.
2. Skydance and Paramount Global to merge
Skydance Media and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) have agreed to merge, the companies announced late Sunday evening, ending months of speculation.
Paramount’s class A stockholders will receive $23 per share in cash or stock, while Paramount’s class B shareholders will receive $15 per share. 
The total cash consideration in the deal for public shareholders will be $4.5 billion, while the overall deal is valued at over $8 billion as it will include a $4.2 billion investment in Paramount by a group comprising the Ellison Family and Redbird Capital.
The deal will see Skydance get access to Paramount's studio assets, streaming service Paramount+ and channels such as Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. 
The new entity will be led by Skydance’s David Ellison as chairman and CEO, and former NBC Universal CEO Jeff Shell (LON:SHEL) as president, and is the culmination of months of sometimes rocky talks.
“Our hope is that the Skydance transaction will enable Paramount’s continued success in this rapidly changing environment,” Paramount Global chair Shari Redstone said. 
3. Boeing pleads guilty to criminal charge
Boeing (NYSE:BA) has agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation into two 737 MAX fatal crashes.
Under the deal, which requires a judge’s approval, Boeing has agreed to pay a $243.6 million fine. It would also result in the planemaker being branded a convicted felon, and could complicate the company's ability to secure lucrative government contracts.
“We can confirm that we have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department, subject to the memorialization and approval of specific terms,” Boeing said in a statement.
However, the plea spares Boeing a potentially costly trial, and could make it easier for the planemaker, which will have a new CEO later this year, to try to move forward as it seeks approval for its planned acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR).
Boeing became exposed to criminal prosecution after the Justice Department in May found the company violated a 2021 settlement involving the fatal crashes.
4. France swings to the left
The leftwing New Popular Front appears to now be the dominant force in France’s National Assembly after Sunday's parliamentary election, after a surge to the left blocked the far-right National Rally party from gaining power.
National Rally had claimed the biggest portion of the national popular vote in the first round of parliamentary elections last week, beating New Popular Front into second and President Emmanuel Macron's centrist bloc into third.
However, the second round of voting has seen the left winning 182 seats, Macron's centrist alliance 168 and Le Pen's National Rally (RN) and allies 143.
There will be some relief within European circles that the far-right won’t be holding the reins of power in France, but the hugely fragmented parliament will likely herald a period of political instability, making it hard for anyone to push through a domestic agenda in the eurozone's second largest economy.
5. Crude hands back some gains
Crude prices slipped lower Monday, handing back some of the gains seen over the last four weeks, on easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.
By 04:10 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) fell 0.7% to $82.57 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.6% to $86.03 a barrel.
Talks over a U.S. ceasefire plan aimed at ending the nine-month-old war in Gaza are under way, and being mediated by Qatar and Egypt.
Concerns over the Israel-Hamas conflict spreading to the wider Middle East region, potentially disturbing the supply of crude, have provided support for the oil markets.
Elsewhere, Hurricane Beryl is expected to make landfall in the middle of the Texas coast later on Monday, potentially passing through the biggest oil exporting regions in the state."
Oppenheimer boosts S&P 500 price target,"Oppenheimer strategists have raised their year-end target price for the S&P 500 to $5,900, up from $5,500, along with an increased earnings projection for the index. This marks the firm’s third price target adjustment for 2024, initially set at 5,200 last December 11.
The latest bullish outlook is supported by S&P 500 earnings results over the last three quarterly reporting periods, alongside economic data showcasing resilience, driven by the Fed’s cautious monetary policy, Oppenheimer noted.
“An innovation cycle that could benefit all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 that shows signs of being both cyclical and secular coupled with cross generational demographic needs that suggest a shift in mindset regarding equities that appears driven adds in our view further support to the case for equities at this time,” strategists said.
On March 25, after the S&P 500 surpassed the initial 5,200 target, the strategists hinted at the possibility of another upward revision should their economic and market outlook prove too conservative.
With the S&P 500 recently closing at a record high of 5567.19, the new target of 5,900 implies a potential gain of just under 6% from the current level, strategists pointed out. This forecast considers typical uncertainties related to economic data, earnings results, and domestic and geopolitical risks.
When Oppenheimer first set the target last December, it projected a 13% upside for the S&P 500 by year-end, based on expectations of the Federal Reserve maintaining a cautious approach in fulfilling its mandate.
The investment bank anticipated the Fed would continue its pause on rate hikes, initiated in June 2023, and despite some economic slowing, saw a lower likelihood of recession due to persistent economic resilience and the Fed's sensitivity to higher-than-expected inflation, which made the 2% inflation target elusive.
At the end of last year, Oppenheimer expected one or two rate cuts from the Fed, one less than the three forecasted by the Fed in December, and significantly fewer than the cuts priced in by the Fed Fund Futures at that time.
“Now just days past the mid-year point of 2024 we expect the Fed to cut once or twice late in the fourth quarter as a “good faith down payment” for Main Street and Wall Street signaling that the central bank is getting closer to an end of the current rate hike cycle if not quite there yet,” strategists continued.
“We would be surprised if the Fed were to cut interest rates as early as September as more than a few market participants are expecting based on the futures that track Fed funds rate expectations,” they said, adding Powell and his colleagues likely want to keep Fed policy independent of politics.
Alongside a year-end price hike, Oppenheimer also raised its 2024 earnings projection for the S&P 500 to $255 from $250."
US election: UBS says 'red wave' is likely coming,"President Biden's underwhelming performance in the recent presidential debate with Donald Trump has sparked concern within his own party, with Democratic leaders and donors increasingly vocal about their doubts regarding his capability to endure another four years in office.
Despite growing calls for him to step aside and withdraw from his re-election campaign, Biden has firmly reiterated his intention to seek the nomination.
Although there are still four months until Election Day, it is notable that Biden's national poll numbers have declined following the June 27 debate. A recent New York Times/Siena College survey indicates that he now trails former President Trump by 5-6 points among likely voters.
“Biden’s path to a second term was already narrow before the debate based upon recent polls in the pivotal states critical to an Electoral College victory,” UBS strategists said in a Sunday note.
“New state-by-state polls are expected in the days and weeks ahead,” they added.
Until President Biden announces a final decision on whether to withdraw, UBS believes it is premature to speculate too much on hypothetical matchups between Trump and other contenders, including Vice President Harris. Regardless of the nominees, strategists expect both political parties to prioritize voter turnout in November as the decisive factor in the election's outcome.
“Democrats must motivate younger voters,” strategists wrote. “Republicans must encourage voters who prefer Trump to express that sentiment reliably at the polls on Election Day.”
UBS has revised its election outcome odds following 10 days of ""unusual campaign activity."" The bank now projects a 45% probability of a ""red sweep,"" where Trump wins with a unified Republican Congress.
The odds for a Biden victory with a divided Congress are now at 30%, while the chances of Trump winning with a divided Congress are at 15%. The likelihood of a ""blue sweep,"" with Biden winning and a unified Democratic Congress, stands at 10%."
"Gold prices dip from 1-mth high; Powell, CPI awaited for more rate cues","Investing.com-- Gold prices fell slightly in Asian trade on Monday as traders awaited more cues on U.S. interest rates from a testimony by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and key inflation data due through the week.
But bullion prices were sitting close to one-month highs, and were also on the cusp of breaking back above $2,400 an ounce amid growing conviction that the Fed will begin cutting interest rates in September. Broader metal prices also benefited from a drop in the dollar, which hit a near one-month low. 
Spot gold fell 0.3% to $2,384.47 an ounce, while gold futures expiring in August fell 0.2% to $2,392.55 an ounce by 00:33 ET (04:33 GMT). 
Gold sits on some gains as rate cut bets increase 
Gold rose sharply through the past week, breaking out of the low-$2,300s as a slew of weak readings on the labor market brewed more optimism over interest rate cuts. Soft nonfarm payrolls data on Friday was a key driver of gold’s gains. 
The yellow metal stands to benefit from lower rates, which are expected to free up more liquidity and also diminish the appeal of the dollar and Treasuries.
The CME Fedwatch tool showed traders pricing in an over 72% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in September, up from 59% seen last week.
Focus this week is on more cues on the U.S. economy and monetary policy. Powell is set to offer a two-day testimony before the Senate and the House, potentially shedding more light on the Fed’s plans for interest rates.
Consumer price index inflation data is also on tap this week and is likely to factor into the central bank’s outlook on rates.
Other precious metals also retreated on Monday, but were sitting on strong gains from last week. Platinum futures fell 0.6% to $1,039.25 an ounce, while silver futures fell 1% to $31.370 an ounce.
Copper mixed amid China fears 
Among industrial metals, copper prices were a mixed bag on Monday as concerns over top importer China remained in play.
Benchmark copper futures on the London Metal Exchange rose 1% to $9,983.0 a tonne, while one-month copper futures fell 0.9% to $4.6235 a pound. 
Concerns over China had battered copper prices in recent weeks, as recent European import tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles ramped up concerns over a trade war with the West. 
Middling economic readings from China had also raised doubts over an economic rebound in the country.
Chinese trade and inflation data is on tap later this week."
Indonesia central bank sees room for Q4 rate cut if rupiah stabilises,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank governor said on Monday there could be room for an interest rate cut in the fourth quarter as the rupiah is expected to be more stable, but will focus its efforts to maintain currency stability for now. 
The rupiah hit a four-year low at 16,475 per U.S. dollar last month due to a strong dollar and on concern about the spending plans of the incoming government.
The rupiah is stabilising after bouts of weakness in recent weeks and there should be a tendency to strengthen later this year due to an expected rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank Indonesia (BI) Governor Perry Warjiyo said.
BI expects the rupiah to trade at an average of between 15,700 to 16,100 per dollar this year, he told parliament. It was trading at 16,250 a dollar as of 0821 GMT.
""We will see if there is any room for easing in the fourth quarter,"" he said. ""For now our focus is maintaining currency stability."""
"Bank of Japan signals progress in wage, price hikes","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan said wage hikes were broadening across the economy due to tight labour market conditions, signalling its confidence the country was making progress toward durably achieving its 2% inflation target.
The optimistic assessment, made at the BOJ's quarterly meeting of regional branch managers on Monday, may heighten the case for the central bank to raise interest rates as soon as its next meeting on July 30-31.
Separate data showed Japanese workers saw their average base pay climb 2.5% in May, the fastest pace in 31 years, suggesting that broadening wage gains will give households more purchasing power and underpin consumption.
""Many regions reported that big firms' big pay hikes in this year's wage negotiations were spreading to small and medium-sized companies,"" the BOJ said in a summary of discussions at the branch managers' meeting.
The assessment compared with that of the previous meeting in April, when the BOJ said there were ""hopeful signs"" solid wage increases among big companies would spread to smaller firms.
Some regional smaller firms decided to prioritise raising pay to retain or hire workers, even if they were not earning sufficient profits, the BOJ summary said, a sign of how Japan's shrinking working-age population is intensifying a chronic labour shortage.
Many regions also saw companies passing on rising costs, or considering doing so, particularly those in the services industry, the BOJ said in the summary.
""We're seeing wages rise not just among big firms but smaller ones,"" said Kazushige Kamiyama, the BOJ's Osaka branch manager who oversees the Kansai western Japan region.
""For firms, higher wages mean higher costs. Some of them are starting to pass on the cost by raising service prices,"" he told a news conference.
The central bank's view on wage developments will be among key factors its board will scrutinise at this month's policy meeting in setting interest rates as well as fresh quarterly growth and inflation projections.
BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has said wage hikes need to trickle down to smaller firms, and companies to begin charging more for services, before the central bank considers raising interest rates from current near-zero levels.
Many market players expect the BOJ to raise rates sometime this year, though they are divided on the timing.
In a sign of the BOJ's optimism on consumption, the regional branch managers said household spending was ""firm as a whole.""
A government survey released on Monday showed sentiment among service-sector firms, seen as a leading indicator of consumption, perked up in June for the first time in four months.
But the rebound was driven mostly by a surge in inbound tourism, which offset the thrifty spending of domestic households who were feeling the pinch from rising living costs.
""A few branches reported that rising inflation was prodding consumers to seek cheaper goods, particularly at supermarkets,"" the BOJ's summary said.
Household spending fell unexpectedly in May as higher prices continued to squeeze consumers' purchasing power. While analysts expect real wages to turn positive in coming months, the yen's recent decline could put upward pressure on import costs.
Core consumer prices in May rose 2.5% from a year earlier, staying above the BOJ's target for more than two years."
"Euro zone investor morale drops, breaking streak of gains in ""setback""","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Investor morale in the euro zone broke an eight-month streak of improvements with a bigger-than-expected decline in July, a survey showed on Monday, describing the results as a ""bitter setback"".
Sentix's index for the euro zone fell to -7.3 points for July from 0.3 in June, putting the barometer firmly back in the red. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected it to drop more moderately to 0.0 this month.
The index on expectations also saw a drop, falling to 1.5 in July from 10.0 in June, a move that Sentix said was ""likely to worry forecasters"".
""The recent recovery of the European economy has come to an abrupt end,"" Sentix said.
The survey said that investors were concerned about French elections, upcoming German state elections and uncertainty over the U.S. presidential election later this year.
Germany's economy, Europe's largest, also saw a fall in morale in July, with the index on the current situation declining to -32.3 from -26.3 in June. The drop follows three consecutive months of gains.
The poll of 1,140 investors was conducted between July 4-6, Sentix said."
Boeing to plead guilty to fraud in US probe of fatal 737 MAX crashes,"By Chris Prentice, Mike Spector and David Shepardson
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge and pay a fine of $243.6 million to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation into two 737 MAX fatal crashes, the government said in a court filing on Sunday.
The plea deal, which requires a judge's approval, would brand the planemaker a convicted felon in connection with crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia over a five-month period in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people. 
The settlement drew swift criticism from victims' families who wanted Boeing (NYSE:BA) to face a trial and suffer harsher financial consequences.
The Justice Department's (DOJ) push to charge Boeing has deepened an ongoing crisis engulfing Boeing since a separate January in-flight blowout exposed continuing safety and quality issues at the planemaker. 
A guilty plea potentially threatens the company's ability to secure lucrative government contracts with the likes of the U.S. Defense Department and NASA, although it could seek waivers.
Boeing became exposed to criminal prosecution after the Justice Department in May found the company violated a 2021 settlement involving the fatal crashes.
Still, the plea spares Boeing a contentious trial that could have exposed the company's decisions ahead of the fatal crashes to even greater public scrutiny. It would also make it easier for the planemaker, which will have a new CEO later this year, to try to move forward as it seeks approval for its planned acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR).
A Boeing spokesperson confirmed it had ""reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department.""
As part of the deal, the planemaker agreed to spend at least $455 million over the next three years to boost safety and compliance programs. Boeing's board will have to meet with relatives of those killed in the MAX crashes, the filing said.
The deal also imposes an independent monitor, who will have to publicly file annual progress reports, to oversee the firm's compliance. Boeing will be on probation during the monitor's three-year term.
Lawyers for some of the victims' families said they planned to press Judge Reed O'Connor, who has been overseeing the case, to reject the deal.
In a separate document filed to the court, they cited O'Connor's statement in a February 2023 ruling: ""Boeing's crime may properly be considered the deadliest corporate crime in U.S. history.""
The deal is a ""slap on the wrist,"" said Erin Applebaum, a lawyer at Kreindler & Kreindler LLP representing some of the victims' relatives.
DEEPENING CRISIS AT BOEING
The DOJ on June 30 offered a plea agreement to Boeing and gave the company until the end of the week to take the deal or face a trial on a charge of conspiring to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which the DOJ in its Sunday court filing said was ""the most serious readily provable offense"".
The fraud centered around knowingly false representations Boeing made to the FAA about new software that saved money by requiring less intensive training for pilots.
The Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) software feature was designed to automatically push the airplane’s nose down in certain conditions. It was tied to the two crashes that led to the FAA grounding the MAX fleet for 20 months, an action that cost Boeing $20 billion and was lifted by the government in November 2020.
A panel blew off a new Boeing 737 MAX 9 jet during a Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines flight, just two days before the 2021 deferred agreement that had shielded the company from prosecution over the previous fatal crashes expired. Boeing faces a separate ongoing criminal probe into the Alaska Airlines incident.
The agreement only covers Boeing's conduct before the fatal crashes and does not shield the planemaker from any other potential investigations or charges related to the January incident or other conduct.
The deal also does not shield any executives, the DOJ filing said, though charges against individuals are seen as unlikely due to the statute of limitations. A former Boeing chief technical pilot was charged in connection with the Boeing fraud agreement but acquitted by a jury in 2022.
The agreed penalty will be Boeing's second fine of $243.6 million related to the fatal crashes — bringing the full fine to the maximum allowed. The company paid the fine previously as part of 2021's $2.5 billion settlement. The $243.6 million fine represented the amount Boeing saved by not implementing full-flight simulator training for MAX pilots.
Families of the victims last month pressed the Justice Department to seek as much as $25 billion.
The DOJ and Boeing are working to document the full written plea agreement and file it in federal court in Texas by July 19, the DOJ said in the court filing."
"Paramount agrees to Skydance merger in $8 billion deal, shares rise","Investing.com-- Shares in Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) (NASDAQ:PARAA) rose after the company said on late Sunday its board had unanimously approved a takeover offer by Skydance Media, ending months of speculation over the deal and opening up a new path for the studio. 
Paramount’s class A stockholders will receive $23 per share in cash or stock, while Paramount’s class B shareholders will receive $15 per share. The total cash consideration in the deal for public shareholders will be $4.5 billion, while the overall deal is valued at over $8 billion. 
The overall deal will include a $4.2 billion investment in Paramount by a group comprising the Ellison Family and Redbird Capital and $1.5 billion of primary capital for the combined entity, called New Paramount.
The company's stock climbed nearly 5% in premarket trading Monday.
Skydance will own roughly 70% of New Paramount’s outstanding shares after the deal. The deal will see Skydance buy National Amusements’ majority stake in Paramount, and will grant  Skydance access to Paramount's studio assets, streaming service Paramount+ and channels such as Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. 
“Our hope is that the Skydance transaction will enable Paramount’s continued success in this rapidly changing environment,” Paramount Global chair Shari Redstone said. 
A special committee of Paramount’s board, which was created earlier this year to oversee the deal, approved the merger over the weekend.
The new entity will be led by Skydance’s David Ellison as chairman and CEO, and former NBC Universal CEO Jeff Shell as president."
"German defence budget for 2025 'significantly' less than sought, minister says","By Maria Martinez
BERLIN (Reuters) -German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said on Monday his ministry had received ""significantly less"" in 2025 budget funding than he had sought for plans to boost annual defence spending by 6.7 billion euros ($7.25 billion). 
Reports by local media, including Bild newspaper, said the ministry would receive an additional 1.2 billion euros, but spokespeople for the government and the minister declined to comment.
Pistorius said the shortfall was ""annoying"", but added that he now had to ""adapt to it and make the best of it"".
""It means I can't initiate certain things as quickly as 'Zeitenwende' and the threat situation require,"" he said upon arrival in Fairbanks, Alaska, referring to the major shift of policy announced by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
The policy shift included the creation of a 100-billion-euro special fund to bring the military back up to speed.
Under the budget deal struck on Friday, Germany's coalition government agreed to keep German defence spending above the NATO target of 2% of gross domestic product, with an additional 30 billion euros in 2028 to meet the target despite the fact that the special fund will have been exhausted.
The mid-term financial planning agreed on Friday foresees a total of 80 billion euros in 2028, ""more than ever before in Germany's history"", Pistorius said. 
Germany's military top brass has warned the armed forces needs additional funds immediately to be combat-ready in five years, when they think Russia will be capable of attacking NATO member-state territory.
Referring to defence spending, Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who also acts as Germany's vice chancellor, said on Monday ""the financial conditions do not suit Germany's security situation.""

France's allies relieved by Le Pen loss but wonder what's next,"By Matthias Williams and Kate Abnett
LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Many of France's allies breathed a sigh of relief after Marine Le Pen's far-right failed to win a snap election on Sunday but they noted that a messy coalition from a hung parliament could also pose headaches for Europe.
Le Pen's National Rally (RN) had been favourite to top the polls, raising the risk of France's first far-right government since World War Two and threatening to upend economic and foreign policy in the euro zone's second-largest economy.
In particular, Ukraine's allies feared a Le Pen-led government could be soft on Moscow and pare back military aid that Kyiv has relied on since the Russian invasion in 2022, though her party has latterly said Russia was a threat.
The National Rally's defeat signals at least a temporary pushback against a far-right surge in Europe, but could herald a period of instability with a new government in an uneasy ""cohabitation"" with President Emmanuel Macron. 
""First of all I am quite relieved there was no right-wing landslide,"" said Germany's Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, lauding efforts to prevent a ""drifting towards nationalism and thereby moving Europe into even more difficult waters.""
""But nevertheless the election result will now represent an enormous challenge, especially for France itself, but of course also for Europe, which is currently in the phase of reorganisation after the European elections, and also for the German-French relationship,"" he added. 
Habeck's government was using contacts with various parties to clarify the challenges ahead, he told reporters in Stuttgart.
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk struck a positive tone.
""In Paris enthusiasm, in Moscow disappointment, in Kyiv relief. Enough to be happy in Warsaw,"" Tusk said on X. 
MACRON'S GAMBLE
Macron had called the snap poll in an attempt to wrest the initiative back from Le Pen but his own party was left trailing behind an alliance of leftist parties that performed far better than expected to take first place.
Several early reactions from overseas rejoiced that the immediate threat of a far-right government had been averted. 
Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares told the radio station RNE he was happy to see a defeat for the far right, which he described as ""completely contrary to European values"".
Nikos Androulakis, the head of Greece's Socialist PASOK party, said the French people had ""raised a wall against the far right, racism and intolerance and guarded the timeless principles of the French Republic: Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.""
Supportive messages came from leaders in Mexico and Venezuela, while Colombia's leftist firebrand President, Gustavo Petro, also congratulated the French for keeping out Le Pen. 
""There are battles that last just a few days but (which) define humanity's fate. France has gone through one of these,"" he said.
An EU official called it a ""huge relief"" but added: ""what it means for Europe on a day to day basis remains to be seen though.""
DEEP DIVISIONS
The election left the French parliament split between three large groups - the left, the centrists, and the far right - with different platforms and no tradition of working together. 
The left wants to cap prices of essential goods like fuel and food, raise the minimum wage and the salaries of public sector workers, at a time when France's budget deficit is already at 5.5% of output, higher than EU rules permit. 
""Bye-bye European deficit limits! (The government) will crash in no time. Poor France. It can console itself with (Kylian) Mbappé,"" said Claudio Borghi, senator from Italy's right-wing League party, referring to the French soccer star.
Other hard-right politicians expressed frustration.
Andre Ventura, leader of Portugal's far-right party Chega, called the result a ""disaster for the economy, tragedy for immigration and bad for the fight against corruption"".
A note by Capital Economics said France may have avoided the ""worst possible outcomes"" for investors, of an outright majority for either Le Pen or the leftists. 
A fractious parliament means however it will be difficult for any government to pass the budget cuts that are necessary for France to comply with the EU's budget rules, it said. 
""Meanwhile, the chance of France's government (and the governments of other countries) clashing with the EU over fiscal policy has increased now that the bloc's budget rules have been re-introduced,"" it said."
"China's car sales slide in June, falling for third month running","BEIJING (Reuters) -China's June car sales fell 6.9% from a year earlier, extending declines for a third straight month as government incentives failed to spur consumer demand in a sputtering economic recovery.
Passenger vehicle sales totalled 1.78 million in June, with the pace of decline picking up from a 2.2% drop in May and a 5.8% fall in April, China Passenger Car Association data showed on Monday.
A cut-throat price war since 2023 helped to lift China vehicle sales earlier in the year but is having less effect in recent months despite fresh government subsidies for trading in cars, which were announced in April.
For the first half overall, China's car sales were up 2.9% at 9.93 million vehicles.
June sales of so-called new energy vehicles including pure electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids accounted for a record 48.1% of domestic car sales. 
Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD (SZ:002594) and relative newcomers such as Nio (NYSE:NIO), Zeekr and Leapmotor (HK:9863) all logged record monthly sales.
Overall growth in electric vehicle sales cooled to 9.9% from 27.4% in May while sales of plug-in hybrids jumped 67.2%, up from a 61.1% increase the previous month.
June car exports were up 28% year on year, against a 23% gain in May, according to separate data from the association.
The trend for exports could weaken, however, after the European Commission last week confirmed provisional import tariffs of up to 37.6% on Chinese-manufactured electric vehicles.
U.S. electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) exported 11,746 Chinese-made vehicles in June, its lowest since October 2022.
Underscoring weakness in consumer demand, a vehicle inventory alert index compiled by the China Automobile Dealers Association rose by 8.3 percentage points year on year to an alarming 62.3% in June."
Thai deputy Finance Minister says need to align policies to lift economic growth,"By Thanadech Staporncharnchai and Orathai Sriring
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's current potential economic growth rate of 3% is not satisfactory and prolonged below-target inflation is dangerous for the economy, a deputy finance minister said on Monday, urging the government and central bank to better align policies.
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy expanded only 1.9% last year, lagging regional peers, as it faced weak exports, high household debt and borrowing costs. The government has said growth will be driven to 3% this year.
Paopoom Rojanasakul made the comments on a local YouTube channel, where he said the government was trying to attract new investment and industries to raise the potential growth rate.
If nothing more is done, the potential growth rate would be around 3% and the economy would expand at the lower end of 2%, he said. 
""That is not something the government is happy about,"" he said, adding fiscal policy was working fully to help growth.
Separately, Paopoom told reporters the government will meet on July 15 to discuss a flagship household handout scheme worth 500 billion baht ($13.7 billion), to be rolled out in the fourth quarter.
On the YouTube channel, Paopoom blamed fiscal and monetary policies not working well enough together in order to help growth reach its potential. 
""I would like us to work together and have a similar way of thinking about managing the economy,"" he said, referring to the government and the central bank.
The government has been in disagreement with the Bank of Thailand (BOT) for months over interest rates, with Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin calling for a rate cut to kick-start the economy.
Despite the pressure to ease policy, the BOT held its key interest rate steady at 2.50% last month, the highest level in over a decade. The next rate review is on Aug. 21.
Last week, BOT Governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput said there was no need currently to cut rates and that structural reforms were needed to boost economic growth, rather than stimulus measures.
Paopoom said inflation running below the BOT's target range of 1% to 3% for a lengthy period was a problem for the economy.
The government wants to adjust the inflation target range, which has been in place since 2020, saying a change should raise the chance of a rate cut.
Sethaput said last week resetting the target range would put at risk credibility, inflation expectations and borrowing costs.

Porsche stops production of some combustion models early,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Porsche is sticking to its guns in its transition to electric vehicles, bringing forward the end of production of some internal-combustion models, the carmaker's head of production told magazine Automobilwoche.
Porsche executive board member Albrecht Reimold said that the petrol-powered version of SUV model Macan for non-European markets would be produced no longer than 2026, sooner than initially projected.
""The platform has reached the end of its cycle,"" said Reimold.
After the production stop the company would focus on electric Macan versions to push Porsche's sustainability agenda, even though EV demand had seen a slump, Reimold was quoted as saying.
""I don't let the success (of the electric Macan) be defined by a single number,"" the executive was quoted as saying.
Combustion engine versions of Boxster and Cayman sportscars, a model range known as 718, would no longer be produced from some time next year and the company is already focused on electric versions to be launched next year, Reimold added.
Production of petrol-powered versions of 718 and Macan for European markets have already been stopped."
French asset prices swing as investors grapple with election result,"By Harry Robertson, Alun John and Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) -French shares and bond prices turned higher in early trading on Monday after initial falls as investors digested elections which left France facing a hung parliament and the prospect of taxing negotiations to form a government. 
A surprise left-wing surge in Sunday's election blocked Marine Le Pen's quest to bring the far right to power in the National Assembly but no single group secured a working majority. 
That meant French assets traded choppily at the open as traders struggled to process relief at the absence of a far right victory, concern about a more powerful left, and uncertainty about who will eventually form a government. 
France's blue-chip CAC40 share index was last up 0.4%, reversing an earlier fall, though still down around 4% since the election was called in early June. 
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) which had opened down around 1%, were last a touch higher. 
Bond markets too were uncertain how to price the outcome and the gap between Germany and France's 10 year bond yields widened to as much as 71.1 basis points but was last a touch narrower at 66.5 bps. 
That spread reflects the premium investors demand to hold French debt rather than euro zone benchmark Bunds. It widened to above 80 basis points in the build-up to the election, its highest since the euro zone crisis in 2012, as investors feared a far-right majority that could implement high spending policies. 
Opinion polls had forecast Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) would be the largest party, but the election leaves France's 577-seat assembly divided in three big groups - the left, centrists, and the far right - with hugely different platforms and no tradition at all of working together.
""It's going to be very hard to actually go ahead and pass any policy and bring about any progressive reforms because each party's vote is split and no one has an absolute majority,"" said Aneeka Gupta, director of macroeconomic research at WisdomTree.
She added, however: ""I think the markets will be happy we're avoiding this extreme situation with the far right.""
Investors also have concerns that the left's plans could unwind many of President Emmanuel Macron's pro-market reforms and believe a gridlock could end attempts to rein in France's debt, which stood at 110.6% of gross domestic product in 2023.
The euro steadied after an initial fall against both the dollar and the pound and was at $1.0835 and 84.58 pence, respectively. 
""It looks like the anti-far right parties really got a lot of support,"" said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex Europe. 
""But fundamentally from a market perspective, there's no difference in terms of the outcome. There's really going to be a vacuum when it comes to France's legislative ability.""
NEXT PRIME MINISTER?
Markets' focus now turns to who will be France's next prime minister. 
Current Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said he would tender his resignation, but it was not clear whether the president would accept it immediately, given the daunting task ahead to form a government. 
Economists at Nomura said they expected a centrist technocratic premier to eventually be installed, and when this happens and ""political uncertainty subsides, we would expect OAT-Bund spreads to tighten again."" 
They said a Prime Minister from left bloc - the New Popular Front - would be ""the most adverse outcome for financial markets."" 
Parties from the NFP - made up of the French Communist Party, hard-left France Unbowed, the Greens and the Socialist Party - met overnight for first talks on how to proceed.
The bloc has no leader, and its parties are deeply divided over who they could select as a suitable premier, though investors remain nervous. 
""The economic programme of the left is in many ways much more problematic than that of the right, and while the left will not be able to govern on their own, the outlook for French public finances deteriorates further with these results,"" said Nordea's chief market analyst, Jan von Gerich."
France faces political deadlock after left-wing shock surge,"France faces a run of complex negotiations to form a government after an unexpected left-wing surge thwarted Marine Le Pen's far-right ambitions.
The New Popular Front (NFP) emerged as the leading force in the National Assembly following Sunday's election. However, no single group has secured a majority, leaving possibilities such as an NFP minority government or a broad, unwieldy coalition on the table.
This outcome deals a significant blow to President Emmanuel Macron, leaving France's position as the euro zone's second-largest economy uncertain and potentially unstable, especially with the Olympic Games approaching. The fragmented parliament will likely weaken France’s influence within the European Union and complicate domestic policymaking.
The election results showed the left-wing coalition securing 182 seats, Macron's centrist alliance with 168, and Le Pen's National Rally and allies with 143, according to the interior ministry data cited by Le Monde.
""According to our institutions' logic, Emmanuel Macron should now invite the New Popular Front to nominate a prime minister,"" said Green leader Marine Tondelier, a potential candidate for the role.
""Will he or won't he? As this president is always full of surprises, we'll see,"" she added in an interview on RTL radio.
Prime Minister Gabriel Attal announced his intention to resign, though it remains unclear if President Macron will accept it immediately given the challenges of forming a new government.
""I will of course do my duties as long as it's needed - it cannot be otherwise on the eve of a date (the Olympics) that is so important for our country,"" Attal said.
Parties within the NFP, including the French Communist Party, hard-left France Unbowed, the Greens, and the Socialist Party, convened overnight to discuss their next steps. France Unbowed's leader, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, argued that the new prime minister should come from the NFP. However, internal divisions make consensus on a premier challenging.
Centrist figures, such as former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, said they were prepared to work towards a stable government but ruled out cooperation with Mélenchon's France Unbowed, viewed by many centrists as extreme.
The euro declined following the announcement of the vote projections."
"Paramount, Skydance merger deal ends Redstone era","By Dawn Chmielewski
(Reuters) -Skydance Media and Paramount Global agreed to merge, the companies announced late on Sunday, scripting a new chapter for one of Hollywood's oldest studios.
The companies agreed to a two-step process in which Skydance and its deal partners will acquire National Amusements, which holds the Redstone family's controlling stake in Paramount, for $2.4 billion in cash.
Skydance will subsequently merge with Paramount, offering $4.5 billion in cash or stock to shareholders and providing an additional $1.5 billion for Paramount's balance sheet.
The deal represents the end of an era for Shari Redstone, whose father and late patriarch, Sumner Redstone, transformed the family's chain of drive-in movie theaters into a media empire that included Paramount Pictures, the CBS broadcast network and cable television networks Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and MTV.
""Given the changes in the industry, we want to fortify Paramount for the future, while ensuring that content remains king,"" Redstone, chair of Paramount and National Amusements, said in a statement, citing a phrase her father coined.
The merger would combine Paramount, home of such classic films as ""Chinatown"", ""The Godfather"" and ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", with its financial partner on several major recent films, including ""Top Gun: Maverick"", ""Mission: Impossible-Dead Reckoning"" and ""Star Trek Into Darkness"".
David Ellison, the 41-year-old tech scion who founded Skydance, will become chairman and chief executive of the new Paramount. Jeff Shell (LON:SHEL), former chief executive of NBCUniversal, will be its new president.
PARAMOUNT'S PAIN
Ellison, son of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison, stands to inherit a media company that has a mountain of challenges, as it navigates an entertainment business upended by the streaming video revolution. 
Paramount has shed nearly $17 billion in value since late 2019, as its traditional television business has eroded faster than its Paramount+ streaming service could turn a profit. 
There has been tension in the executive suites. Its chief executive, Bob Bakish, was ousted in April after clashing with Redstone over the Skydance deal. He was replaced by a trio of executives who occupy the ""office of the C.E.O.,"" a group that has proposed making $500 million in cuts, selling off certain assets, and exploring a possible joint venture partner for Paramount+.
Ellison pledged to bring ""best-in-class"" technology and modern infrastructure to Paramount+ and the free streaming service, Pluto TV, even as it enhanced Paramount's traditional television networks.
""We are committed to energizing the business and bolstering Paramount with contemporary technology, new leadership and a creative discipline that aims to enrich generations to come,"" Skydance said in a prepared statement announcing the deal.
The Paramount-Skydance deal came together after months of talks that appeared to have derailed when Redstone abruptly called off negotiations on June 11. 
At that time, Skydance and its partners had reached an agreement to acquire National Amusements, which owns 77% of the voting shares of Paramount. However, talks reached an impasse over other issues, including National Amusements' request that the deal be approved by a majority of non-Redstone shareholders, a condition Skydance considered a non-starter.
Other prospective bidders for National Amusements emerged: independent Hollywood producer Steven Paul, Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman, who is backed by private equity firm Bain Capital, and IAC Chair Barry Diller. Even earlier,  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Pictures and buyout firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) had expressed interest, though a deal never materialized.
Meanwhile, discussions between Ellison and Redstone quietly resumed, and became more constructive, according to two people familiar with those discussions.
NEW DEAL
Skydance sweetened the Redstone family's payout for the sale of National Amusements to $1.75 billion, said one of the sources familiar with deal terms. It also enhanced legal protections from possible shareholder lawsuits, clearing the way for a new agreement, the source said.
Under the terms of the agreement, Ellison's Skydance will merge with Paramount in an all-stock transaction that values Skydance at $4.75 billion, creating a company with an enterprise value of $28 billion.
Ellison and his financial backers, the Ellison Family and Redbird Capital Partners, will pay $15 a share in cash or stock to Paramount's non-voting Class B shareholders, representing a 48% premium as of July 1.
Holders of the Class A voting stock would receive $23 a share in cash or stock, or a 28% premium as of July 1. 
Once the transaction closes, Skydance's investor group will own 100% of the new Paramount's Class A voting shares and 69% of its outstanding B shares.
The deal also gives Paramount 45 days to find a better offer, leaving open the possibility of yet another plot twist in an already chaotic deal process."
"Indonesia sees 2024 budget deficit at 2.7% of GDP, finance minister says","JAKARTA (Reuters) -Indonesia's budget deficit this year is estimated at 2.7% of gross domestic product, higher than the government's 2.29% target, as state spending is expected to increase due to the rupiah's depreciation, its finance minister said on Monday.
The rupiah hit 16,475 per U.S. dollar last month, its weakest in four years, due to a strong dollar and on concern about the spending plans of the incoming government. It has weakened by around 6.3% in the first half of the year.
The government's spending on fuel subsidies has increased due to the weaker rupiah, but Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said the government will remain vigilant in its debt management and will optimise the use of its excess cash from last year's budget. 
The government will use around 100 trillion rupiah ($6.15 billion) excess from last year to reduce debt issuance this year, she said.
""Hopefully this will help maintain macroeconomic stability, especially the exchange rate movements and government bond yields,"" she told the parliamentary budget committee. 
In the first six months of 2024, the government posted a fiscal deficit of 0.34%, data presented at the hearing showed. 
Said Abdullah, the committee chair, warned the government about the risk of lower tax revenue this year and suggested that it put on hold projects that had a smaller impact on economic growth.

"Jobs, rural India likely to be focus of new Modi government's first budget, says Goldman Sachs","MUMBAI (Reuters) - The first budget by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's new government may tilt towards, but not pivot to welfare spending, with a focus on rural economy and job creation, economists at Goldman Sachs said in a note on Monday.
The budget proposal for the financial year ending March 2025 will be presented on July 23, the government said over the weekend.
Goldman economists expect the government to stick to its fiscal deficit target of 5.1% of GDP set in the interim budget but said it will likely make an ""overarching statement"" about long-term economic policy.
""We see an emphasis on job creation through labor-intensive manufacturing, credit for micro, small and medium enterprises, continued focus on services exports by expanding global capability centres, and a thrust on domestic food supply chain,"" Santanu Sengupta, chief India economist at the Wall Street bank wrote.
Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party failed to win a majority on its own in national elections this year and returned to power with the help of allies. Post-poll surveys showed that unemployment and inflation were key concerns among voters, particularly outside of urban areas.
While the Indian economy is seen growing a fast clip of 7.2% this year, job creation has lagged.
""Even 7% GDP growth might not be able to fulfill the job requirement over the next decade,"" Citi's chief India economist Samiran Chakraborty said in a note last week, adding that growth of close to 7% will generate 8 million to 9 million jobs per year, short of the 11 million to 12 million needed.
Goldman expects the budget to push labour intensive manufacturing through fiscal incentives across sectors like toys, textiles and apparel manufacturing, along with commercial aircraft manufacturing. 
Citi, in a report, said the government could consider extending its flagship production linked incentive scheme with a focus on ""more domestic value addition and explicit employment targets.""
Almost two-third manufacturing jobs are in low-skilled labor-intensive sectors, Citi said, without specifying whether these announcements would be made in the budget.
Goldman also expects a focus on agricultural infrastructure and incentives to increase domestic production of key crops as a way to target high food inflation, which has been running close to 8% for many months.

Oil slips as Gaza talks ease supply disruption woes; Hurricane Beryl in focus,"By Florence Tan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Oil prices slid on Monday after rising for four weeks, as the prospect of a ceasefire deal in Gaza eased geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, while investors assessed potential disruption to U.S. energy supplies from Tropical Storm Beryl. 
Brent crude futures were down 36 cents, or 0.4%, at $86.18 a barrel, as at 0646 GMT.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $82.71 a barrel, down 45 cents, or 0.5%.
Talks over a U.S. ceasefire plan aimed at ending the nine-month-old war in Gaza are under way, and being mediated by Qatar and Egypt.
""If anything concrete comes from the ceasefire talks, it will take some of geopolitical bid out of the market for now,"" said IG analyst Tony Sycamore based in Sydney.
The ports of Corpus Christi, Houston, Galveston, Freeport and Texas City closed on Sunday to prepare for Hurricane Beryl, which is expected to make a landfall in the middle of the Texas coast between Galveston and Corpus Christi later on Monday.
Port closures could bring a temporary halt to crude and liquefied natural gas exports, oil shipments to refineries, and motor fuel deliveries from those plants.
""While this puts some offshore oil and gas production at risk, the concern when the storm makes landfall is the potential impact it could have on refinery infrastructure,"" ING analysts led by Warren Patterson said in a note.
""Any meaningful disruptions to Texas refinery operations will likely support refined product cracks.""
IG's Sycamore said there is also a good chance of U.S. data showing another large weekly draw in U.S. oil inventories amid peak driving season, which will be supportive for oil prices.
WTI gained 2.1% last week after data from the Energy Information Administration showed stockpiles for crude and refined products fell in the week ended June 28. [EIA/S]
""WTI has had a very good run, though, having rallied 15% from the early June low,"" Sycamore said, adding that the benchmark could see strong resistance between $85.50 and $87.50 based on technical charts.
The number of operating oil rigs in the U.S. were unchanged at 479 last week, holding at its lowest since December 2021, Baker Hughes said in its weekly report on Friday.
Oil prices were also supported last week by hopes of interest rate cuts following U.S. data on Friday that showed inflation is easing and job growth slowing.
Lower interest rates can boost economic activity and increase crude oil demand.
Investors were also watching for any impact from elections in the UK, France and Iran last week on geopolitics and energy policies.
France faced potential political deadlock after elections on Sunday threw up a hung parliament while Iranians chose Masoud Pezeshkian as their new president, a relative moderate who beat a hard-line rival in the election."
