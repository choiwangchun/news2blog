WATCH LIVE: Fed Chair Jerome Powell Testifies on Capitol Hill,"Powell says easing too soon, too much, could harm inflation progress. Easing too little, too late could unduly weaken the economy.
Powell said that ""in light of the progress made both in lowering inflation and in cooling the labor market over the past two years, elevated inflation is not the only risk we face.” He adds that “reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.”
Fed Chair Powell's Testimony Could Provide Rate Cut Clues
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver his semi-annual testimony on Tuesday, a highly anticipated event that could provide significant insights into the central bank's future monetary policy.
As markets await his remarks, investors and analysts are keen to decipher any signals about the direction of interest rates and the Fed's approach to managing inflation and economic growth.
Powell's testimony comes at a pivotal moment, with the Fed Chair likely to face questions on factors such as the interest rate path, inflation, and the economic growth outlook.
He is also expected to speak on the key takeaways of the Fed's Semi-Annual Federal Reserve Monetary Policy Report, published last Friday, highlighting modest further inflation progress this year.
Investors are particularly focused on Powell's stance regarding future rate cuts. Data recently showed a sharp rise in expectations for a September rate cut by the Fed, although some believe the first rate cut will arrive in December.
In a note to clients Tuesday, analysts at Macquarie said they believe Powell's tone will be dovish.
""Last week's FOMC Minutes already displayed a shift in the Fed's tone, toward caring more about the loosening labor market and softening activity indicator,"" they wrote. ""If Congress issues strong calls to have President Joe Biden abandon his candidacy, and if that raises the prospect that Donald Trump will win, it could raise US yields again.
""For good reasons, traders like to link Trump's policy agenda with inflation; they see policy rates being higher than otherwise under Trump 2.0, as we've discussed.""
As Powell takes the stand, markets will be closely monitoring his every word for clues about the Fed's future actions.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/watch-live-fed-chair-jerome-powell-testifies-on-capitol-hill-3511863
US stocks mostly higher; tech sector gains ahead of Powell's testimony,"Investing.com-- U.S. stocks mostly edged higher Tuesday as increased expectations for a September rate cut kept the tech sector buoyant before testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 
At 09:35 ET (13:35 GMT), Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 40 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 rose 10 points, or 0.2%, and NASDAQ Composite rose 75 points, or 0.4%. 
Powell testimony in focus
Powell is set to begin his two-day testimony before Congress, starting later Tuesday with the Senate before the House on Wednesday. 
The Fed Chair is expected to offer more cues on monetary policy, with markets watching for any dovish signals, especially in the wake of softer inflation and labor data in recent weeks. 
Beyond Powell’s testimony, several other Fed officials are also set to speak this week, including open markets committee members Michelle Bowman and Raphael Bostic.
Investors will also be looking to key consumer price index inflation data for June, which is due on Thursday, for more cues on the path of inflation. The Fed has repeatedly signaled that it needs more confidence that inflation is easing, before it can begin cutting interest rates.
The CME Fedwatch tool showed traders pricing in an over 70% chance for a 25 basis point cut in September, up from last week’s 59%. 
Confidence that rate cuts are coming shortly resulted in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite eking out record highs on Monday. 
Earnings season to begin with banks
Focus this week will also be on the second quarter earnings season, which is set to begin with results from several major banks at the end of the week. 
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) are set to report quarterly earnings on Friday.
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) are also on tap this week. 
Analysts, on average, see S&P 500 companies increasing their aggregate earnings per share by 10.1% in the second quarter, up from an 8.2% increase in the first quarter, according to LSEG I/B/E/S data.
Additionally, the likes of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to post gains, both rising over 2%, amid growing confidence in all things linked with artificial intelligence. 
Crude slips after Beryl passes
Crude prices edged lower Tuesday, after Hurricane Beryl caused less damage to a key U.S. oil-producing region than expected, easing concerns over supply disruption.
By 09:35 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) fell 0.2% to $82.14 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.2% to $85.56 a barrel.
Market participants are also keeping an eye on the situation in the Middle East, as hopes of a possible ceasefire deal in Gaza, potentially reducing worries about global crude supply disruption, hit crude prices on Monday.
The American Petroleum Institute releases its estimates of weekly crude inventories later in the session, with a draw expected given the summer driving season.

"A 'deeper' S&P 500 pullback is coming, Piper Sandler warns","Piper Sandler analysts are cautioning investors about a potential correction in the S&P 500, despite recent highs. Their note highlights a weakening market that could lead to a significant pullback.
In today's note warning of a potential correction, Piper Sandler stated: ""Deteriorating market breadth and narrowing leadership"" are the key concerns.
This means that fewer stocks are participating in the rally, and investors are focusing on a limited group of high-performing companies. They argue that this undermines the sustainability of the current upswing.
However, it goes against a separate note from the firm this week that said its analysts believe Wall Street will remain bullish until unemployment reaches 4.5% and they remain constructive. Even so, they flagged that most market downturns occur from either higher rates or unemployment.
Nevertheless, Piper Sandler said its technical indicators also point towards a correction. Piper Sandler's ""40-week Technique indicator"" shows a low number of stocks trending positively, suggesting weaker market internals.
While the recent jobs report might lead to a Fed rate cut, Piper Sandler says other factors are concerning.
""The MID and RTY are below their 50-day MAs and poised for a leg lower toward their respective 200-day MAs,"" the firm states, indicating a potential decline in mid-cap and small-cap stocks.
Despite maintaining its year-end target, Piper Sandler expects a ""deeper pullback/correction in the coming months."" They believe the S&P 500 is overdue for a 10% correction towards its long-term uptrend. In conclusion, Piper Sandler advises investors to be cautious. The current market dynamics suggest a correction is likely, and investors should prioritize vigilance over complacency.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/a-deeper-sp-500-pullback-is-coming-piper-sandler-warns-3511440
How to trade AI? Citi says take profits as sentiment is most elevated since 2019,"Citi analysts warned investors about potentially overheated sentiment in Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks.
Their note highlights how optimism surrounding AI stocks has reached its highest level since 2019, based on factors like market expectations and historical price movements.
""Sentiment around stocks with high exposure to AI is the most elevated it has been since 2019,"" states Citi.
This concern stems from a combination of factors. Firstly, Citi's estimates for future growth in these stocks are significantly lower than what market prices currently imply. Secondly, the recent price surge of AI stocks significantly outpaces historical growth trends. Finally, options market data suggests a potential imbalance towards bullish bets on AI.
Citi recommends capitalizing on this situation by taking profits on high-flying AI stocks, particularly those in the ""enabler"" category, such as semiconductor companies. ""We continue to suggest investors take profits in AI highfliers,"" advises Citi.
Investors can then reinvest these profits ""more broadly across the theme's value chain,"" creating a more balanced portfolio within the AI sector.
For those who are even more cautious about the AI market, Citi offers an alternative strategy: the AI Hedge Basket.
This basket is designed to benefit from a potential decline in AI stocks. ""We introduce the AI Hedge basket as an alternative to outright shorting,"" explains Citi. The basket prioritizes companies with negative correlations to high AI exposure stocks, offering a hedge against potential losses.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/how-to-trade-ai-citi-says-take-profits-as-sentiment-is-most-elevated-since-2019-3511343
Russia talks up business with India as Modi visits Moscow,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia and India agreed to increase cooperation in sectors ranging from nuclear power to shipbuilding and discussed how to fix payments problems as their leaders met in Moscow on Tuesday. 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on a two-day visit to Moscow and met Russian President Vladimir Putin at an event that also saw state-owned Russian enterprises announce deals and tout plans for projects involving India. 
Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom said it was discussing building six more nuclear power units in India; the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) inked pharma, shipbuilding and education agreements; and Russia's second-largest bank spoke of efforts to ease payment flows as trade between the two nations increases.
Under a barrage of Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, Russia has pivoted away from European countries to what it calls ""friendly"" nations such as India and China to diversify and reorient trade flows. 
Putin, joining Russian businesses in the charm offensive, bestowed on Modi the Order of St Andrew, Russia's highest honour.
Construction of the first two units of India's Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project, which uses Soviet-designed VVER-1000 reactors, began nearly two decades ago in the southern state of Tamil Nadu as part of a project signed by both countries.
Rosatom said new areas of cooperation were being discussed - the construction of six more high-power units of Russian design at a new site and some Russian-designed small nuclear power plants. 
Rosatom and Indian partners were also discussing developing the transit potential of the Northern Sea Route (NSR), which runs from Murmansk near Russia's border with Norway eastwards to the Bering Strait near Alaska, particularly concerning supplies of Russian oil, coal and liquefied natural gas, Rosatom said. 
Russia hopes the NSR will transport 150 million metric tons in 2030, up from 80 million tons this year. 
SHIPBUILDING, PHARMA, PAYMENTS
The RDIF and India's Enso Group agreed on a partnership for joint investments worth up to 20 billion roubles ($227 million) in infrastructure development for shipbuilding, Russian agencies reported. 
Many Russian companies see huge potential in India, RDIF chief Kirill Dmitriev told reporters on the sidelines of the Putin-Modi meeting. Other deals in education and pharma were agreed, he said. 
A major stumbling block to trade has been payment flows. VTB Bank CEO Andrei Kostin said there was constructive dialogue on the issue but acknowledged lingering problems. 
""There are, of course, problems linked to sanctions, there are problems related to the incomplete convertibility of the rupee, there are problems related to ... a wide range of trade and economic relations, there is unbalanced trade,"" Kostin told reporters.

Ireland to break spending rule again in pre-election budget,"By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) -Ireland will increase public expenditure by 6.9% in 2025, again breaking the government's own budget rule capping spending growth at 5% and eating into projected budget surpluses to hand Dublin a much bigger than planned pre-election budget. 
The 8.3 billion euro ($8.9 billion) package was far ahead of the 5.7 billion euro assumed a year ago and will allow ministers to cut tax and increase spending in October, ahead of an election that analysts expect in November.
Ireland's central bank and its independent fiscal watchdog have warned against breaking the budget rule again, saying it risked stoking inflation, damaging competitiveness and overheating the economy. 
Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe, who designed the rule in 2021, defended breaching it for the third successive year, saying it had ""performed an important service"" in putting downward pressure on spending after bigger increases during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Donohoe and new finance minister Jack Chambers cited the need to accommodate higher capital spending and provide more public services for a larger-than-assumed population as a reason for the breach. They said that three-quarters of the additional spending was needed just to maintain existing service levels. 
The government had put previous breaches down to the need to help ease a cost of living crunch. Inflation fell to a more than three-year low of 1.5% last month.
The plans are funded by one of healthiest public finances in Europe, but will result in a lower projected budget surplus of just under 6 billion euros for 2025 compared with the 9.7 billion euros forecast in April.
Additional healthcare spending for this year announced on Tuesday will also cut the forecast 2024 surplus to just over 7 billion euros from earlier projected 8.6 billion euros, or 2.8% of national income, previously pencilled in.
The government plans to put almost all of those remaining surpluses, which are entirely driven by booming corporate tax receipts paid by Ireland's hub of large multinationals, into new savings and sovereign wealth funds.
The budget package comes on top of the 4.5 billion euros already set aside for costs the government says may not repeat fully into the future, such as accommodating Ukrainian refugees.
The ministers said they were also considering topping up the pot on budget day with one-off cost of living supports. Similar measures last year ran to 2.7 billion euros.

Wall Street analysts bullish on genetic testing firm Tempus AI,"(Reuters) - Wall Street brokerages started covering SoftBank (TYO:9984) Group-backed Tempus AI on a bullish note on Tuesday, betting that the company's AI-powered library of clinical and molecular data could lead to more powerful diagnostic and test kits.
The Chicago, Illinois-based company sells genomic diagnostics tests across oncology and other areas, including neuropsychiatry, radiology and cardiology to clinicians and hospital systems.
Seven brokerages, including J.P.Morgan, Morgan Stanley, BofA Global Research and Stifel initiated coverage with a ""buy"" or ""overweight"" rating, with the highest price target of $50 by TD Cowen.
The brokerages, which were underwriters for Tempus' initial public offering, issued their first ratings after the so-called ""quiet period"" ended on Tuesday.
The upbeat ratings lifted the shares of the company by 6.9% to $35.57. The stock has lost 17.5% since the closing on June 14, its debut day, till the end of trade on Monday.
J.P.Morgan forecasts roughly 33% revenue growth for Tempus through 2027. It expects the company to turn a core profit by the second half of 2025.
Tempus AI's net loss widened to $289.8 million in 2023 from $214.1 million a year earlier, while total revenue jumped 65.8% to $531.8 million.
The ""uniquely combined clinical genomic data, which the company has successfully monetized in the form of licensing agreements with pharma and biotech customers"" separates Tempus from rivals, according to J.P.Morgan.
Morgan Stanley expects revenue growth of 27% through 2028, and expects the company to break-even on core profit by 2027.
The brokerage noted that if competitors tried to grow their own database, it would ""likely prove to be costly, cumbersome and time-consuming efforts"".
BofA Global Research said there is space for Tempus to further expand the scope of the existing relationships with biotech and large pharma companies as well as increase the number of new customers.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wall-street-analysts-bullish-on-genetic-testing-firm-tempus-ai-3511973
"France's election outcome 'negative' for credit rating, Moody's warns","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) -The outcome of France's parliamentary election is negative for the country's credit rating, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) has warned, as a grand coalition would make decision-making and the task of bringing its debt under control more difficult.
France is facing complex negotiations to form a government after a left-wing surge in elections on Sunday blocked Marine Le Pen's quest to bring the far right to power.
Possibilities include the left forming a minority government - which would be at the mercy of a no confidence vote from rivals unless they reach deals - and the cobbling together of an unwieldy coalition of parties with almost no common ground. 
""In light of the constraints that any future government faces, we are unlikely to see expenditure-based fiscal consolidation in 2025,"" Moody's said in a note, echoing many of the concerns S&P Global voiced on Monday.
France is also unlikely to be able to push through further tax hikes, given that its tax-to-GDP ratio is already the highest in the OECD, Moody's added.
""Hence, the fiscal implications of the election outcome are credit negative,"" said the ratings agency, whose current Aa2 ""stable"" outlook rating on France is a notch higher than both S&P and Fitch. 
France's spending trajectory means its general government deficit is not likely to drop below 4% of GDP until 2027, by which point its near 110% debt-to-GDP ratio will have ballooned a few more percentage points.
Moody's pinpointed a trio of triggers for a rating change.
* The outlook would move to negative if, for example, the fiscal and debt numbers looked likely to be materially worse than previously expected, in particular its interest payments relative to revenue and GDP. 
* There was a weakening commitment to fiscal consolidation.
* There was a reversal of the labour market liberalisation and pension reforms of the last seven years that Moody's thought would materially dampen the country's medium-term growth potential and/or fiscal trajectory.
""The current unprecedented circumstances will test French institutions and policy effectiveness,"" Moody's said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/frances-election-outcome-negative-for-credit-rating--moodys-3511656

"Fed's Powell: ""More good data"" will ""strengthen"" case for rate cut","By Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Inflation ""remains above"" the U.S. Federal Reserve's 2% target, but has been improving in recent months and ""more good data would strengthen"" the case for central bank interest rate cuts, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday in congressional testimony. 
In comments that appeared to show increasing faith that inflation will return to the Fed's target, a requirement for easing monetary policy, Powell compared the lack of progress on that front in the first months of the year to recent improvement that has helped build the Fed's confidence that price pressures will continue to diminish.
As well, the chair noted, the Fed is now also concerned about risks to the job market and economy should rates remain too high for too long. 
""After a lack of progress toward our 2% inflation objective in the early part of this year, the most recent monthly readings have shown modest further progress,"" Powell said in remarks to be delivered to the Senate Banking Committee. ""More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving
sustainably toward 2%.""
The Fed receives consumer price information for the month of June on Thursday.
A jobs report on Friday showed a still-solid 206,000 jobs added in June, but with a slowing monthly trend and a rising unemployment rate now at 4.1%.
Powell called that a ""still low level,"" but also noted that ""in light of the progress made both in lowering inflation and in cooling the labor market over the past two years, elevated inflation is not the only risk we face.""Leaving policy too tight for too long, ""could unduly weaken economic activity and employment,"" Powell said, undermining a period of economic growth that he said ""remains solid"" with ""robust"" private demand, improved overall supply conditions, and a ""a pickup in residential investment."" 
Powell's comments may firm expectations for changes to the policy statement to be released after the Fed's July 30-31 meeting that at least open the door to a September rate cut now given a roughly 70% probability by investors - barring a surprise jump in coming inflation readings.
At the Fed's June 11-12 meeting the median projection of 19 officials was for just a single quarter-point rate cut by the end of the year, but since then inflation data has come in weaker than expected.
The consumer price index did not rise at all in May, and analysts anticipate another weak reading when new data is released on Thursday. 
Powell's testimony is his latest in a semiannual round of hearings on monetary policy, with questions from Senators to follow his remarks. He will appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT).
The congressional hearings also typically see Powell questioned on a broad array of topics, and that grilling could be more intense ahead of a November presidential election in which the Fed's decision to either move forward with or postpone rate cuts is likely to become part of the debate. 
The inflation target is set in reference to the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which as of May was increasing at a 2.6% year-over-year rate.
That is down from its pandemic-era peak, but the inflation shock remains a potent political debating point.
In a report to Congress released on Friday ahead of Powell's testimony, the Fed noted that there was good reason to believe that price pressures, particularly in the housing market, a significant contributor to inflation's recent persistence, were in decline.
Combined with concerns about the job market, that should ""leave the Fed fretting more about the risk of recession than of sticky inflation,"" economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote after the last jobs report.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/feds-powell-before-congress-could-show-developing-case-for-rate-cut-3511322
