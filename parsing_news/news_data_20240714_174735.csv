Trump heading for 'a landslide' win after attempted assassination: investors,"Former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. The shooting incident occurred at a rally for former Trump, which investors believe could increase his chances of reclaiming the White House.
Trump sustained a gunshot wound to the ear while the attacked was reportedly neutralized. Despite the severity of the event, he was seen raising his fist shortly after the attack.
His campaign has confirmed that he is in stable condition following the assassination attempt.
In response to the shooting incident, investors anticipate a rise in market activities betting on Trump's victory in the upcoming week.
""From memory, Reagan went up 22 points in the polls after his assassination attempt. The election is likely to be a landslide. This probably reduces uncertainty,"" Nick Ferres, Chief Investment Officer at Vantage Point Asset Management, told Reuters. 
Prior to the attack, the possibility of Trump's return to office had already led to a stronger dollar and investors positioning for a steeper yield curve in U.S. Treasuries. These market movements are expected to gain further momentum, according to Rong Ren Goh of Eastspring Investments.
The shooting marks the first time a U.S. president or major party candidate has been shot since the attempt on President Ronald Reagan's life in 1981.
""I do think this will have a shock reaction on a market that has been on tenterhooks on the U.S. election.
""I see the odds of the Trump trade getting reinforced over the next few months till November, unless the Democrats can come up with a really credible alternative,"" commented Hemant Mishr, Chief Investment Officer at S Cube Capital.
Following this incident, billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk endorsed Trump.
All in all, the failed assassination attempt is likely to significantly impact the presidential race, which has shown a close contest in opinion polls.

Trump survives assassination attempt,"Former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump survived an attempted assassination Saturday evening at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.  A would-be assailant fired multiple shots at Mr. Trump from an elevated position just outside the security perimeter, striking him in the right ear.  Trump was immediately rushed off stage, and the shooter was killed. Trump emerged from the shooting shouting, ""Fight! Fight! Fight!""
“I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear,” Trump said on his Truth social media platform after the incident. “I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through my skin.”
The shooter has been identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old man from Pennsylvania, The New York Post reported.
In addition to the shooter, one rally attendee was killed, and two other spectators were injured.
“… I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person at the Rally who was killed, and also to the family of another person that was badly injured,” Trump added.
The U.S. Secret Service said the incident is an active investigation and has formally notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
“During former President Trump’s campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on the evening of July 13th at approximately 6:15 pm, a suspected shooter fired multiple shots toward the stage from an elevated position outside of the rally venue.  US Secret Service personnel neutralized the shooter, who is now deceased,” the U.S. Secret Service said in a statement.
The shooting took place just under four months before the November 5 election, where Trump is set to compete again with Democratic President Joe Biden. According to most opinion polls, including those by Reuters/Ipsos, the two candidates are neck and neck in popularity.
President Biden condemned the shooting, saying: “There’s no place for this kind of violence in America. We must unite as one nation to condemn it.""
Ron Moose, a supporter of Trump present in the crowd, recounted the scene: ""I heard about four shots and saw the crowd immediately drop down. Trump also ducked quickly. The Secret Service swiftly surrounded and shielded him—it was all within a second.""
Moose described witnessing a man running while being pursued by officers in military attire. He mentioned hearing more gunfire but was unsure of its source. He observed snipers positioned on the roof of a warehouse near the stage.
The BBC interviewed an eyewitness who reported seeing an armed man with a rifle crawling up a roof adjacent to the event. This individual, whose identity was not disclosed by the BBC, stated that he and others began pointing towards the man, attempting to alert security.
""This horrific act of political violence at a peaceful campaign rally has no place in this country and should be unanimously and forcefully condemned,"" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said on social media.
""Political violence has no place in our country,"" Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.

Deflation in China is spilling over into the US and euro area: Morgan Stanley,"Deflationary pressures originating from China's economic slowdown are beginning to reverberate across global markets, particularly impacting the US and Eurozone through reduced goods prices, Morgan Stanley said on Monday.
China's prolonged period of deflation, its deepest since the 1990s, is exacerbating excess capacity issues despite recent policy measures aimed at stabilization, the investment banking firm said in its latest note titled “China's Deflationary Spillovers”.
The spill-over effects are most pronounced in core goods sectors, notably impacting apparel and electronics, which led to a marginal reduction in core inflation rates by approximately 0.1% in the US and Euro area, primarily driven by a significant decline in core goods inflation of around 0.5%, noted Morgan Stanley.
""While the overall impact remains relatively modest,"" said Morgan Stanley adding, ""it provides central banks like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank with additional leeway to consider monetary easing measures throughout the year.""
Analysts at Morgan Stanley pointed out that China's dominant position in global goods exports amplifies its role as an exporter of deflation. This has broader implications for sectors reliant on imported goods, such as the US apparel market, where CPI components could see declines of up to 0.3% due to lower import prices from China, they added.
Looking ahead, Morgan Stanley anticipates continued challenges for China's inflationary outlook, projecting a slow recovery with the Producer Price Index (PPI) expected to exit deflationary territory only by the second half of 2025.
The cautious optimism aligns with forecasts suggesting nominal GDP growth in China will remain subdued, staying below 5% over the next few years, as per Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley economists caution that sustained deflationary pressures could persist unless significant shifts towards consumption-led growth strategies are implemented in China's economic policy despite efforts to stimulate manufacturing investment.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/deflation-in-china-is-spilling-over-into-the-us-and-euro-area-morgan-stanley-432SI-3518199
What's driving the US unemployment rate higher?,"The recent uptick in the US unemployment rate to 4.1% is gaining attention and prompting a more dovish tone from Federal Reserve officials, according to analysts.
The increase in the unemployment rate, calculated from the Household Survey, is attributed to a rise in labor supply rather than job losses.
Specifically, 75% of the 543,000 year-to-date jump in unemployed individuals is due to re-entrants (353,000) and new entrants (99,000) to the labor force. The surge has contributed to a 0.27% rise in the unemployment rate this year.
Analysts suggested that the Household Survey may be understating immigration trends and indicated an even more strong labor supply than the data shows. The imbalance between labor supply and demand is particularly evident in lower-wage industries, which typically hire a higher proportion of foreign-born workers, it said.
Moreover, the Federal Reserve meeting minutes showed a shift in focus from solely inflation concerns to a more balanced approach between inflation and employment. Some Fed officials noted that while the labor market remains strong, the ratio of vacancies to unemployment has returned to pre-pandemic levels.
Analysts noted that the balance brings risks to the Committee’s dual mandate goals, necessitating careful monitoring of labor market conditions.
A number of Fed participants had noted that with the labor market normalizing, any further weakening in demand could lead to a larger increase in unemployment. The sensitivity to demand fluctuations underscores the importance of the Fed’s balanced approach, as per analysts",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/whats-driving-the-us-unemployment-rate-higher-432SI-3518203
Pro Research: Wall Street eyes Walmart's strategic moves,"Company Overview
Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), a global retail leader, operates through three segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International, and Sam's Club. The company has evolved into a prominent figure in the retail sector, known for its low prices and wide array of products and services. With a strong culture centered on consumer needs and core values, Walmart serves over 275 million customers weekly through its extensive network of stores and e-commerce platforms in 24 countries. As part of the ""Big Three"" alongside Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart is committed to integrating digital and physical shopping experiences, maintaining a competitive stance against other retail giants. Strategic acquisitions and investments in infrastructure reflect the company's dedication to growth, innovation, and higher-margin businesses like advertising.
Market Performance and Analyst Ratings
Walmart's stock has demonstrated resilience in a volatile economic landscape, with analyst sentiment remaining positive. Recent analyses from Evercore ISI and Stifel have reiterated ""Outperform"" and ""Hold"" ratings, respectively, with Evercore ISI setting a price target of $72.00 and Stifel at $69.00. These revisions reflect Walmart's strong market performance, showcasing a stock price ranging from a 52-week low of $50 to a high of $68, and a current price of $65.88. J.P. Morgan has upgraded Walmart to ""Overweight"" with a price target of $81.00, highlighting the company's balance of defensive and offensive strategies. KeyBanc maintains an ""Overweight"" rating with a target of $75.00, emphasizing Walmart's resilience and market share gains. Gordon Haskett and D.A. Davidson both set a ""Buy"" rating with a $75.00 price target, citing Walmart's strategic initiatives and potential for continued growth.
Sales and Earnings Prospects
Walmart has surpassed expectations with Q1 net sales of $161.5 billion, exceeding consensus estimates. Adjusted EPS for Q1 was $0.60, beating estimates of $0.52. The company's updated FY'24 guidance anticipates net sales growth of 3.0% - 4.0%, operating income growth of 4.0% - 6.0%, and adjusted EPS of $2.23-$2.37. Looking ahead to FY'25, Walmart expects net sales of $677.45 billion and EPS of $2.42, with FY'26 projected to bring in $702.22 billion in revenue and $2.58 EPS. Analysts forecast strong growth in global e-commerce and advertising sales, with Walmart's U.S. comp sales and EPS estimates raised, reflecting confidence in the retailer's upward trajectory and potential for digital profitability by the end of 2024.
Strategic Initiatives and Consumer Trends
Walmart's strategic initiatives are paying dividends, with investments in automation poised to reduce costs and drive market share gains. The company is years ahead of competitors in creating an ecosystem that encompasses improved stores, a top-tier digital presence, and a rapidly growing advertising business. Walmart's model is shifting towards higher profitability with less volatility. The company's focus on energy drinks, pet food, and beauty products, alongside new private labels like bettergoods, is attracting higher-income consumers and driving brand loyalty. The acquisition of VIZIO for $2.3 billion aligns with Walmart's plan to expand into higher-margin businesses, justifying a higher valuation multiple.
Competitive Landscape and Market Share
Walmart continues to expand its market share, particularly in the grocery sector, by attracting higher-income consumers with its delivery and pickup services. The company's advertising revenue is expected to grow significantly, indicating a robust revenue stream outside traditional retail sales. Despite intense competition, Walmart's scale, diverse offerings, and strategic investments reinforce its competitive edge. Roth MKM suggests that Walmart's shared locations with Target could impact Target's performance as consumer value-seeking behavior intensifies.
External Factors and Risks
The retail sector faces macroeconomic pressures, and Walmart must navigate challenges such as inflationary pressures, industry consolidation, and reduced discretionary spending. However, the company's robust holiday sales and diminishing concerns over deflation point to a strong consumer outlook. Fuel/FX assumptions are now seen as a modest tailwind compared to previous models. Walmart's defensive positioning is favored due to softening discretionary spending and uncertainty in the second half of 2024, including the presidential election cycle and holiday calendar challenges.
Bear Case
While Walmart's U.S. EBIT has faced challenges, the potential risks associated with deflation in general merchandise have lessened. The company's strategic initiatives and investments in higher-margin businesses, such as advertising and membership, could mitigate these concerns. However, potential cost headwinds, a tight labor market, and competition with Amazon may impact operations. Global margin pressures from consumables mix or competitive markets also pose risks.
Walmart's significant omni-channel investments and market share gains underscore its competitive strength. The company's strategy, including the expansion of private label offerings and penetration, supports its market position. Nonetheless, general merchandise deflation and the need to maintain strong price gaps in the face of increased rollbacks present potential risks. Traffic trends may not reach pre-pandemic levels until after 2024, potentially affecting the company's performance.
Bull Case
Walmart's investment in omni-channel infrastructure and the projected increase in advertising revenue suggest a bright future. The company's strategy to draw in higher-income consumers with delivery and pickup services, along with its acquisition of VIZIO, is poised to enhance its financial performance in the coming years. Strong U.S. comp sales outperforming consensus expectations and high-margin business segments are driving growth, potentially justifying a higher valuation multiple.
Analysts have highlighted Walmart's strong unit volume growth and market share gains as indicators of competitive strength that could positively influence stock performance. The company's diverse growth across various segments, including grocery and general merchandise, underscores its adaptability and potential for further expansion.

"Trump-victory trades to swell after shooting, investors say","By Tom Westbrook and Vidya Ranganathan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Saturday's shooting at U.S. former President Donald Trump's election rally raises his odds of winning back the White House, and trades betting on his victory will increase this coming week, investors said on Sunday.
Trump was shot in the ear during the rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday in what the authorities were treating as an assassination attempt. Trump, his face spattered with blood, pumped his fist moments after the attack and his campaign said he was fine after the incident.
Before the shooting, markets had reacted to the prospect of a Trump presidency by pushing the dollar higher and positioning for a steeper U.S. Treasury yield curve, and those trades could strengthen in the coming week, said Rong Ren Goh, a portfolio manager in the fixed income team at Eastspring Investments in Singapore. 
The first shooting of a U.S. president or major party candidate since a 1981 assassination attempt on Republican President Ronald Reagan could upend the Nov. 5 rematch between Republican Trump and President Joe Biden, a Democrat, which has been tight in opinion polls.
""From memory, Reagan went up 22 points in the polls after his assassination attempt. The election is likely to be a landslide. This probably reduces uncertainty,"" said Nick Ferres, chief investment officer at Vantage Point Asset Management.
World leaders and U.S. politicians condemned the shooting, while some industry executives, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief Elon Musk, declared their support for Trump.
Since a shaky performance against Trump in a presidential debate two weeks ago, Biden has faced growing doubts from donors, supporters and fellow Democrats about his ability to beat Trump and keep up with the demands of the job.
Immigration and economy have been the main issues for U.S. voters and, according to Reuters/Ipsos polls, they see Trump as the better candidate for the economy, even as Biden’s White House seeks to benefit from a solid economy with inflation slowing and unemployment low. 
Under Trump, market analysts expect a more hawkish trade policy, less regulation and looser climate change regulations.
Investors also expect an extension of corporate and personal tax cuts expiring next year, fuelling concerns about rising budget deficits under Trump.
Trump said in an interview in February he would not re-appoint Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose second four-year term as chair will expire in 2026. 
Longer-end Treasury yields have risen alongside the odds of a second Trump administration.
While the moves in the still-inverted Treasury curve have primarily been driven by changing expectations about the Fed's first rate cut in this cycle, the gap between 2-year and 30-year notes has narrowed to a negative 6 basis points from a negative 30 bps around the time of the Biden-Trump debate.
The more closely watched gap between two- and 10-year Treasury yields is at a negative 27 basis points, half the levels three weeks ago.
“Trump has always been more 'pro-market'. The key issue looking forward is whether fiscal policy remains irresponsibly loose and the implication that might have for (renewed) inflation and the future path of interest rates,"" said Ferres.
Stock prices have been rising. Both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes hit record highs on Friday and the S&P 500 is up 18% this year. 
""Around the five presidential elections of the last 20 years, CEO confidence, consumer sentiment, and particularly small business optimism have shifted more favorably in response to Republican victories than Democratic victories,"" analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote.
""To the extent improved sentiment leads to an increase in spending and investment, a Trump victory could boost the earnings outlooks for some firms even without substantial policy changes.""
Soon after the shooting, billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman endorsed Trump. Musk also endorsed Trump, calling him ""tough"" on his social media platform X.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/trumpvictory-trades-to-swell-after-shooting-investors-say-3518202

Here are investors' reactions to the shooting.
NICK TWIDALE, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, ATFX GLOBAL, SYDNEY
""I think it probably increases his chances, and we will probably see some haven flows in the morning.""
RONG REN GOH, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, EASTSPRING INVESTMENTS, SINGAPORE
""The shooting is likely to bolster Trump's support, and only further augments the positive momentum he has been enjoying following the Presidential debates two weeks ago. 
""The market reaction function to a Trump presidency has been characterized by a stronger U.S. dollar and a steepening of the U.S. Treasuries curve, so we might observe some of that this coming week if his election odds are assessed to have further improved following this incident.""
NICK FERRES, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, VANTAGE POINT ASSET MANAGEMENT, SINGAPORE
""From memory, Reagan went up 22 points in the polls after his assassination attempt. The election is likely to be a landslide. This probably reduces uncertainty.

""I do think this will have a shock reaction on a market that has been on tenterhooks on the U.S. election.
""I see the odds of the Trump trade getting reinforced over the next few months till November, unless the Democrats can come up with a really credible alternative.

"World leaders condemn shooting at Trump rally, denounce political violence","By Kanishka Singh
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - World leaders have rapidly condemned Saturday's attack on Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania in which the former president was shot in the ear, expressing shock, denouncing political violence and wishing him a quick recovery.
The Trump campaign said later that Trump, who is running again for the White House in November's U.S. election, was ""doing well."" The FBI identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the ""subject involved"" in what it termed an attempted assassination. 
A spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the shooting and called it an ""act of political violence.""
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said: ""We must stand firm against any form of violence that challenges democracy."" 
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was ""appalled by the shocking scenes"" at the rally. ""Political violence in any form has no place in our societies and my thoughts are with all the victims of this attack.""
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said there was ""no justification"" for such violence and he was ""relieved"" that Trump, who has frequently criticized U.S. military aid to Ukraine amid Russia's invasion, was safe and wished him ""a speedy recovery.""
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the shooting was ""concerning and confronting,"" while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it left him ""sickened."" Trudeau added: ""Political violence is never acceptable."" 
Similar comments were also made by the leaders of the European Union, Egypt, Thailand, Taiwan, South Korea, New Zealand, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and the Philippines. 
""It is a tragedy for our democracies,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said of the shooting. ""France shares the shock and indignation of the American people.""

Trump shot in ear at campaign rally after major security lapse,"By Nathan Layne, Brendan McDermid and Jeff Mason
BUTLER, Pennsylvania (Reuters) -Donald Trump was shot in the ear during a campaign rally on Saturday after a major security lapse, an attack that will likely reshape this year’s presidential race and fuel long-standing fears that the campaign could descend into political violence.
In the moments after the shooting, Trump was swarmed and covered up by his security agents. He quickly emerged, his face streaked with blood, and pumped his fist in the air, mouthing the words ""Fight! Fight! Fight!"" The Trump campaign later said he was ""doing well."" 
The FBI identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the ""subject involved"" in what it termed an attempted assassination in a statement early on Sunday. He was a registered Republican, according to state voter records.
Earlier the Secret Service said in a statement that the shooter was dead, one attendee at the rally was killed and two other spectators were injured. Law enforcement officials told reporters they not yet identified a motive for the attack.
Trump, 78, had just started his speech when the shots rang out. He grabbed his right ear with his right hand, then brought his hand down to look at it before dropping to his knees behind the podium before Secret Service agents covered him. 
He emerged about a minute later, his red ""Make America Great Again"" hat knocked off, and could be heard saying ""wait, wait,"" before pumping his fist in the air. Agents then rushed him to a black SUV.
""I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear,"" Trump said later on his Truth Social platform following the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, about 30 miles (50 km) north of Pittsburgh. ""Much bleeding took place.""
He left the Butler area under the protection of the U.S. Secret Service with the assistance of the Pennsylvania state police and later arrived at his golf resort and residence in Bedminster, New Jersey.
The shooting occurred less than four months before the Nov. 5 election, when Trump, the Republican candidate, faces an election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden. Most opinion polls including those by Reuters/Ipsos show the two locked in a close contest.
Trump is due to receive his party's formal nomination at the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on Monday.
The shooting raised immediate questions about security failures by the Secret Service, which provides former presidents including Trump with lifetime protection.
It was the first shooting of a U.S. president or major party candidate since the 1981 attempted assassination of Republican President Ronald Reagan.
'NO PLACE' FOR SUCH VIOLENCE
Leading Republicans and Democrats quickly condemned the violence. 
""There’s no place for this kind of violence in America. We must unite as one nation to condemn it,"" Biden said in a statement. 
Ron Moose, a Trump supporter at the rally, said he heard about four shots. ""I saw the crowd go down and then Trump ducked also real quick,"" he said. ""Then the Secret Service all jumped and protected him as soon as they could. We are talking within a second they were all protecting him.""
The BBC interviewed a man who described himself as an eyewitness, saying he saw a man armed with a rifle crawling up a roof near the event. The person, who the BBC did not identify, said he and the people he was with started pointing at the man, trying to alert security.
The shots appeared to come from outside the area secured by the Secret Service, the agency said. The FBI said it had taken the lead in investigating the attack.
At a briefing late on Saturday, FBI officials told reporters it was surprising that the suspect was able to fire multiple shots. The Secret Service did not have a representative at that briefing, which included FBI and state law enforcement officials.
Hours after the attack, the Oversight Committee in the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives summoned U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to testify at a hearing scheduled for July 22.
""Americans demand answers about the assassination attempt of President Trump,"" the panel said in a statement on social media.
REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS DECRY VIOLENCE
The attack heightened longstanding worries that political violence could erupt during the presidential campaign and after the election. The concerns in part reflect the electorate's polarization, with the country appearing bitterly divided into two camps with divergent political and social visions.
""This horrific act of political violence at a peaceful campaign rally has no place in this country and should be unanimously and forcefully condemned,"" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said on social media.
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was horrified by what happened and was relieved Trump was safe. ""Political violence has no place in our country,"" he said. 
Biden's campaign was pausing its television ads and halting all other outbound communication, a campaign official said.
Americans fear rising political violence, recent Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, with two out of three respondents to a May survey saying they worried violence could follow the election.
Some of Trump's Republican allies said they believed the attack was politically motivated.
""For weeks Democrat leaders have been fueling ludicrous hysteria that Donald Trump winning re-election would be the end of democracy in America,"" said U.S. Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, who survived a politically motivated shooting in 2017. 
""Clearly we’ve seen far left lunatics act on violent rhetoric in the past. This incendiary rhetoric must stop.""
Trump, who served as president from 2017-2021, easily bested his rivals for the Republican nomination early in the campaign.
He has largely unified around him the party that had briefly wavered in support after his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, attempting to overturn his 2020 election defeat.
The businessman and former reality television star entered the year facing a raft of legal worries, including four separate criminal prosecutions. 
He was found guilty in late May of trying to cover up hush money payments to a porn star, but the other three prosecutions he faces -- including two for his attempts to overturn his defeat -- have been ground to a halt by various factors including a Supreme Court decision early this month that found him to be partly immune to prosecution.
Trump contends, without giving evidence, that all four prosecutions have been orchestrated by Biden to try to prevent him from returning to power.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/trump-shooting-raises-questions-about-security-lapses-3518198
