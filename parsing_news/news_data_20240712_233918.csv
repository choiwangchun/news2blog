"S&P 500, Nasdaq open modestly higher despite hotter than expected June PPI","Investing.com-- Major US indices showed little movement in early Friday trade despite key earnings reports from major banks such as JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo. These reports are set to propel the second-quarter earnings season forward.
At 09:35 AM EST (13:35 GMT), the S&P 500 was up 0.15% while Nasdaq rose 0.08%. Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) gained 0.2%.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the largest bank in the United States, saw its stock decline modestly after Q2 net interest income (NII) matched analyst expectations.
On the other hand, Wells Fargo's Q2 NII missed market expectations by around $200 million, causing shares to drop about 6%. Citi stock gained 1.5% after the bank reported earnings.
Investors are looking forward to robust profit growth from a diverse range of companies, which could potentially extend the rally in U.S. stocks beyond the dominant tech sector.
""If analysts’ predictions are accurate, this quarter’s year-over-year EPS growth rate will be the highest since the fourth quarter of 2021,"" Bernstein analysts wrote in a note.
Tech-heavy Nasdaq suffered a setback of nearly 2% on Thursday. This decline was influenced by a shift in investor interest from large-cap stocks to smaller companies amid increasing expectations that the Federal Reserve will slash rates in September. 
Market participants are now pricing in an 86% chance of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September, an increase from the 72% probability observed a week prior.
US producer price index is now up 2.6% year over year
The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics released the producer price index (PPI) report for June, which surpassed Wall Street forecasts.
The PPI, which measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output, saw a 0.2% increase last month, contrary to the 0.1% rise anticipated by economists.
This latest figure places the PPI 2.6% higher than the same period last year. Notably, the increase in prices for services in June helped to counterbalance a decline in the prices for goods.
Moreover, the May PPI reading was revised upwards, showing no change compared to the initially reported 0.2% decrease.
The higher-than-expected PPI data contrasts with recent trends suggesting a decline in inflation. It follows the release of the June consumer price index (CPI), which was reported on Thursday and came in lower than expected.
The CPI, a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services, indicated that headline inflation had decreased on a monthly basis, with a year-over-year rate of 3%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) extends losses after UBS downgrade
Tesla stock fell a further 3.3% Friday after UBS downgraded the stock's rating from Neutral to Sell.
The brokerage firm acknowledged the positive developments in Tesla's diverse business areas but expressed concerns over the heightened expectations for its core Automotive division.
The analysts pointed out that Tesla has historically enjoyed a premium valuation due to anticipated growth in various initiatives, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI). Despite Tesla's current market capitalization reflecting over $500 billion in value for future growth, the analysts argued that justifying a Buy rating would require an even greater growth opportunity.
While recognizing the progress in AI, UBS cautioned that the investment is expensive, the pace of improvement could decelerate, and the return on investment is likely to be realized in the distant future. They suggested that a waning market enthusiasm for AI could adversely affect Tesla's stock multiple.
The recent reversal in Tesla's stock price ends an 11-day rally, which was initially sparked by a robust second-quarter deliveries report that temporarily eliminated the stock's year-to-date losses.
With the latest decline, Tesla's shares have once again dipped into negative territory for the year 2024.
Asian tech slammed by profit-taking, Nikkei slides 2%
Tech-heavy indexes in Asia, which had mostly outpaced their regional peers in recent weeks, clocked the heaviest losses on Friday. The sector saw a heavy degree of profit-taking after hype over AI sparked a major melt-up in valuations this year.
Traders were seen pivoting into other economically-sensitive sectors, which are now set to benefit from lower interest rates.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was emblematic of this trend, slumping 2.2% from record highs hit on Thursday. The broader TOPIX, which is a lot less tech-heavy than the Nikkei, fell 0.9%. Chipmakers  Renesas Electronics Corp  (TYO:6723),  Advantest Corp.  (TYO:6857) and  Tokyo Electron Ltd.  (TYO:8035) slid between 4% to 7%, while tech investment house SoftBank Group Corp. (TYO:9984) lost 3.2%. 
South Korea’s KOSPI slid 1.4% with memory chip making major  SK Hynix Inc  (KS:000660) losing over 3%.
TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM), the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, and a key driver of the recent tech rally, slid over 4% from record highs. 
Hong Kong outperforms on bargain buying, ASX hits record high 
But major Chinese technology stocks largely ducked weakness in their global peers, as relatively lower valuations in the sector drove in a slew of bargain hunting.
Hong Kong-listed Chinese tech majors such as  Baidu  (NASDAQ:BIDU) Inc (HK:9888), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) rose over 2% each, which helped the Hang Seng index rally 2%. The index also pulled further away from a two-month low hit earlier this week.
Chinese markets fell less than their broader peers, with the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes treading water on Friday.
Australia’s ASX 200 outperformed its Asian peers, rising 0.9% to a record high of 7,969.10 points. The index, which has a relatively small weightage of technology stocks, was boosted by flows into economically sensitive sectors such as mining and industrials.
These sectors advanced across the board in Asia, given that they are expected to benefit from a low interest rate environment. 
Futures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a flat open, with gains in industrials and consumer stocks set to offset losses in tech. The Nifty and the BSE Sensex 30 had both scaled record peaks earlier this week amid persistent optimism over the Indian economy.

Biden 'may have just committed an unforced tactical error'. UBS explains how,"President Biden began his much-awaited press conference on Thursday evening by reviewing the NATO Summit in Washington and highlighting his administration’s accomplishments.
His opening remarks served as a robust defense of multilateral engagement as the cornerstone of American foreign policy and were also aimed at creating a more favorable context for addressing media questions regarding his physical and mental fitness.
According to UBS strategists, Biden’s performance during the conference was ""decidedly mixed,"" with energetic comments on gun control being undermined by missteps concerning the capability of his own vice president to assume the presidency and win a national election.
""In short, the presser is unlikely to change many minds over whether he should continue to pursue the nomination at next month's convention,"" UBS strategists remarked.
""At least one response may come back to haunt the president,” strategists added.
Near the end of the press conference, when asked whether convention delegates should be obligated to vote for him, Biden stated that the delegates “are free to do whatever they want.” Currently, rules direct delegates to reflect the “sentiments of those who elected them.”
This response might inadvertently give the party’s rules committee a chance to change the instructions given to delegates, potentially allowing them to vote their conscience in the first round of balloting.
""While the probability of a rule change is still low, the president may have just committed an unforced tactical error,"" strategists concluded.
In his first response during the conference, Biden mistakenly referred to Vice-President Kamala Harris as ""Vice-President Trump,"" further fueling widespread concerns about his verbal missteps. This error occurred merely an hour after he incorrectly introduced Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky as “President Putin” during the NATO summit.",https://www.investing.com/news/politics/biden-may-have-just-committed-an-unforced-tactical-error-ubs-explains-how-3517539
"JPMorgan posts strong Q2 earnings, tops expectations","JPMorgan (JPM) reported a robust second quarter, with earnings surpassing analyst expectations, but its stock declined, falling over 2% at the open.
The financial giant announced an EPS of $4.40, which was $0.26 higher than the consensus estimate of $4.14.
The firm's net income stood at $18.1 billion, marking a significant 25% increase, bolstered by a $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa (NYSE:V) shares and a $1.0 billion donation of Visa shares to pre-fund contributions to the Firm’s Foundation. Net revenue also experienced a notable rise, up 20% to reach $51.0 billion. Excluding the Visa-related gain, noninterest revenue was up 14%, driven by higher investment banking fees, asset management fees, and CIB Markets noninterest revenue.
Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon commented on the quarter's performance, highlighting the company's net income of $13.1 billion and a return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 20%, after accounting for the Visa shares gain and other discretionary items. Dimon also pointed out the significant growth in the company's CIB segment, with investment banking fees increasing by 50% and market share improving to 9.5% year-to-date (YTD). Moreover, the Card Services net charge-off rate was reported at 3.50%.
The provision for credit losses was $3.1 billion, which included net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million. The net charge-offs were up $820 million, primarily due to Card Services. The net reserve build consisted of $609 million in Consumer, mainly in Card Services, and $189 million in Wholesale.
Dimon also emphasized the company's vigilance regarding potential economic risks, including geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures. He noted the firm's strong capital position, with a CET1 ratio of 15.3%, and mentioned the Board's intention to increase the common dividend for the second time this year, reflecting a 19% cumulative increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.
JPMorgan's performance in the second quarter demonstrates its ability to navigate a complex economic environment while continuing to invest in long-term growth and maintaining a robust balance sheet. The company's prudent management and strategic investments have positioned it well for future challenges and opportunities.
Reacting to the report, analysts at RBC Capital said in a note: ""Overall, relative to the uncertainty going into the quarter JPM reported strong core second quarter results, driven by better-than-expected fee revenues, partially offset by a higher provision and higher expenses.”
Analysts at Evercore ISI told investors that it is ""hard to call a 20% ROTCE & a bigger than expected buyback anything but a good quarter, but our gut is with growth driven by strong results in capital markets, asset & wealth management and Cards, but flattish trends in loans & deposits and no change to guidancein NII (or expenses), we could see a little pressure on the stock in light of its recent good run,"" they added.
Furthermore, analysts said that while there are some issues in the quarter to go through, they see a ""ton of capital at a 15.3% CET1, lots of cash/NII optionality, a tame credit outlook and continued investment in organic growth across the company.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/jpmorgan-posts-strong-q2-earnings-tops-expectations-shares-dip-3517155
"Citi lists 'Trump trades': Short oil, US over Europe, and more","Citi analysts outlined several strategic trades dubbed ""Trump trades,"" in a note Friday, focusing on the anticipated market movements influenced by a potential Trump presidency and the upcoming Fed actions.
While these trades hinge on different factors, Citi's take is clear: ""Most Trump trades may have to wait for after the Fed.""
Citi suggests that steepeners are an exception among the Trump trades, benefiting from both a dovish Federal Reserve and election-related shifts.
Analysts emphasize the attractiveness of steepeners due to the expected rate cut in September. Additionally, positioning for the outperformance of US equities over European equities can be done earlier.
However, Citi cautions against entering this trade at the current level, noting that ""French equities did not participate in the rebound in other French assets post-election, making it a poor entry point.""
Citi's analysts have a bearish outlook on oil, foreseeing a downside by late 2025.
They believe that ""expectations of a Trump presidency should add to the fundamental case for oil downside,"" citing potential tariffs that may undermine demand and geopolitical shifts that could act as a headwind. This bearish stance is part of a broader strategy, where oil typically does not perform well heading into US elections.
On the currency front, Citi has adjusted its positions, closing its long USDSEK trade and adding a long AUDCAD trade. The latter is expected to benefit from ""deteriorating US growth, with the rest of the world holding on,"" which is USD bearish.
The trade is further supported by favorable terms of trade and central bank actions, alongside a typically positive influence from the upcoming Chinese third plenum.
Overall, Citi's analysts are preparing for significant market movements influenced by both the Federal Reserve's actions and potential political developments, with specific strategies tailored to navigate these anticipated changes.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/citi-lists-trump-trades-short-oil-us-over-europe-and-more-3517032
"Yen bounces, traders wary of more Japan intervention","(Reuters) - The yen jumped against the dollar on Friday, with traders on high alert for signs of fresh intervention by authorities, after a surge in the Japanese currency on Thursday that was likely the result of official buying.
The dollar fell as much as 1% to a one-month low of 157.30 yen, and was last at 158.1 yen. The euro was last down 0.3% at 172.04 yen. 
Japan's Ministry of Finance was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters. 
Daily operations data earlier in the day suggested the Bank of Japan (BOJ) may have spent over 3 trillion yen ($18.85 billion) on defending the currency on Thursday, less than three months after it last intervened. 
It was not immediately clear what was behind the latest move. Several analysts noted it bore some of the hallmarks of official buying, but the yen's strengthening was more modest than Thursday's, raising some doubt as to whether or not it could be the central bank.
""It could be a modest further round of intervention. I wouldn't be as confident as yesterday when the move was much bigger,"" Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets, said.
""Given that we have the Japan holiday on Monday, it's not a bad time for them (Japanese authorities) to enforce the move. 
""It's not the greatest of shifts of the yen so far, so I wouldn't be overly confident that it's them,"" he added. 
The yen is still trading around its weakest in 38 years, largely as a function of the wide gap between U.S. and Japanese interest rates that make it highly profitable for traders to borrow in yen to fund holdings in dollar assets that offer more attractive returns.

Apple shares climb on report Foxconn factories ramp-up hiring ahead of iPhone 16 launch,"Shares of Apple (AAPL) have been given a boost Friday after a report from the South China Morning Post said manufacturer Foxconn is increasing hiring in the world's largest iPhone plant in Zhengzhou, capital of central Henan province.
The hiring increase is said to come as Apple prepares for the launch of its next-generation handset this autumn.
The publication said, citing recruitment posts published by the company this week, that for returning workers previously employed by the factory, the iPhone assembler is offering an approximately $3.44 hourly rate (25 yuan) and a bonus of up to 7,500 yuan.
According to the SCMP, a job post by a local labor agency said to be one of several promoting opportunities at the factory read: ""The peak season for Foxconn's Zhengzhou plant is happening now: high-paying jobs for temporary workers and returning employees.""
Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 models are highly anticipated due to their expected support for the US tech giant's new artificial intelligence (AI) features, set to arrive early next year.
The Cupertino, California-based company is relying on the AI upgrade to increase sales. According to a report from Bloomberg, their aim is to ship at least 90 million iPhone 16 devices in the second half of this year, which represents a 10$ growth compared to the previous generation. 
Apple iPhone demand in China has declined recently, with sales in the country declining due to rising competition from local rivals, including Huawei Technologies. 
The SCMP says Apple currently ranks third in the country, behind Vivo and Huawei spin-off Honor. Apple was reportedly trying to defend its share in the China smartphone market by offering steep discounts during the China midyear online shopping season, known as 618. 
The SCMP, citing job posts, added that to prepare for the new iPhone, Foxconn is also raising salaries for temporary workers at its campus in China's southern tech hub of Shenzhen.

ISS suggest Enhabit shareholders elect three AREX Capital nominees to board,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) on Thursday said Enhabit shareholders should elect three AREX Capital Management director candidates to the nine member board, arguing the company needs more expertise in home health, hospice and public company financial reporting.
The prominent proxy advisory firm, whose recommendations often guide shareholder votes on proposed mergers and who serves on a board, said AREX made a convincing case that new directors are needed. But the hedge fund did not persuade ISS that a majority of the two-year-old company's directors should be ousted, the report reviewed by Reuters said.
AREX is asking investors to replace seven directors to help reverse poor financial performance. It has also been pushing the home health and hospice provider to put itself up for sale.
Investors will vote on July 25 unless the two sides reach an agreement before the meeting date.
Enhabit on Friday urged stockholders to vote for all its nine nominees, adding it disagrees with ISS's recommendation as critical experience would be lost by replacing the directors. 
""The company's significant underperformance, both from a TSR (total shareholder return) and operational standpoint, indicate that a degree of change is needed at the board level,"" ISS wrote. Enhabit's stock price has tumbled nearly 60% since it was spun off of post-acute healthcare services provider Encompass Health (NYSE:EHC) in July 2022.
ISS recommended votes for AREX candidates Gregory Sheff, who has home health operations experience, Anna-Gene O'Neal, who has hospice experience, and Mark Ohlendorf, who has public company chief financial officer experience.
AREX, which owns a 4.9% stake in Enhabit, is backing Enhabit CEO Barbara Jacobsmeyer and director Barry Schochet for reelection. Schochet joined the board last year when the company reached an agreement with investors Cruiser Capital and Harbour Point Capital Management in March 2023. 
AREX told Enhabit last year that it wanted the company to commit to immediately start a strategic review before the end of 2023. Enhabit in May said it decided to continue as an independent, public company after having evaluated a range of strategic options.
AREX declined to comment.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/iss-suggest-enhabit-shareholders-elect-three-arex-capital-nominees-to-board-3517198
US producer prices rise moderately in June,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased moderately in June, further confirmation that inflation had resumed its downward trend and strengthening the case for a September interest rate cut.
The producer price index for final demand rose 0.2% last month after being unchanged in May, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI nudging up 0.1%.
In the 12 months through June, the PPI increased 2.6% after advancing 2.4% in May.
The government reported on Thursday that consumer prices fell for the first time in four years in June amid cheaper gasoline and a broad deceleration in the costs of goods and services, including rents. 
The tame inflation data followed news last week of a rise in the unemployment rate to a 2-1/2 year high of 4.1%.
With the Federal Reserve now wary of labor market weakness, economists and financial markets are increasingly betting on a rate cut in September, with another reduction in borrowing costs expected in December. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the improving inflation environment during his testimony before lawmakers this week, but also highlighted the risks to the labor market saying ""we have seen considerable softening."" 
The U.S. central bank has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range since last July. It has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points since 2022.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-producer-prices-rise-moderately-in-june-3517407
"Wall St set for muted open after mixed bank results, PPI data","(Refiles to drop extraneous numbers from paragraph 7. The story was previously corrected to fix the comparative period in the same paragraph)
By Medha Singh and Ankika Biswas
(Reuters) - Wall Street was set for a subdued open on Friday as investors digested mixed results from big banks, while slightly hotter-than-expected producer price numbers reined in bets that the Federal Reserve would begin easing interest rates in September.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM)'s second-quarter profit increased on a boost from rising investment banking fees and an $8 billion accounting gain from a share exchange deal with Visa (NYSE:V). However, shares of the world's largest bank edged 0.2% lower in choppy premarket trading.
Wells Fargo slid 5.5% as the lender missed estimates for quarterly interest income, while Citigroup rose 2.8% after posting a surge in investment banking revenue and gains in its services division.
The results come against a backdrop of expectations that some of the largest U.S. banks would report weaker second-quarter profits due to lower interest payments and higher provisions for deteriorating loans.
As the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq scale new peaks, investors are hoping for strong profit growth from companies beyond heavyweight tech names such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), so that the U.S. stocks rally can broaden out.
""Big bank earnings, big tech earnings and consumer company earnings will be the most important to watch, as these companies are highly levered to the strength of the economy,"" said Clark Bellin, president and chief investment officer, Bellwether Wealth.
Analysts, on average, expect earnings for S&P 500 firms to grow by 10.1% during the quarter from a year ago, compared with a 2.8% decline in the same period in 2023, according to LSEG IBES data. Financial firms are likely to post a profit growth of 6.7%.
After data showed a surprise fall in U.S. consumer prices on Thursday, solidifying bets on a September rate cut, the latest report showed producer prices rose 0.2% on a monthly basis in June, compared to an expectation of a 0.1% rise. Annually, it rose 2.6%, versus an estimated 2.3% rise.
""Friday's stronger-than-expected PPI is an important reminder that inflation is still here and that the inflation data can be volatile,"" Bellin said.
Traders still see a 93% chance of a rate cut in September, up from 72% a week ago, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool.
Focus now turns to the University of Michigan's consumer survey report, due after markets open.
At 8:47 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 22 points, or 0.05%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 1.25 points, or 0.02%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 1.5 points, or 0.01%. 
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq logged their worst sessions in more than two months on Thursday, on a rotation out of high-flying large-cap stocks in favor of small-cap shares, which have underperformed this year. The rotation has also set the blue-chip Dow on track for its best week in four. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) dropped 1.7% after UBS downgraded the EV maker's stock to ""sell"" from ""neutral"".
BNY climbed 2.5% after the U.S. bank posted a 10% rise in second-quarter net profit.
AT&T (NYSE:T) dropped 1.5% after the telecom firm said data from about 109 million customer accounts containing records of calls and texts from 2022 had been downloaded illegally in April.

US consumer sentiment ebbs in July; inflation expectations improve,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment ebbed in July, but inflation expectations over the next year and beyond improved, a survey showed on Friday.
The University of Michigan's preliminary reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment came in at 66.0 this month, compared to a final reading of 68.2 in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a preliminary reading of 68.5.
""Nearly half of consumers still object to the impact of high prices, even as they expect inflation to continue moderating in the years ahead,"" said Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu.
""With the upcoming election, consumers perceived substantial uncertainty in the trajectory of the economy, though there is little evidence that the first presidential debate altered their economic views.""
The survey's reading of one-year inflation expectations dipped to 2.9% from 3.0% in June. Its five-year inflation outlook also fell to 2.9% from 3.0% in the prior month.",https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/us-consumer-sentiment-ebbs-in-july-inflation-expectations-improve-3517589
