WATCH LIVE: Fed Chair Jerome Powell Testifies on Capitol Hill,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver his semi-annual testimony on Tuesday, a highly anticipated event that could provide significant insights into the central bank's future monetary policy.
As markets await his remarks, investors and analysts are keen to decipher any signals about the direction of interest rates and the Fed's approach to managing inflation and economic growth.
Powell's testimony comes at a pivotal moment, with the Fed Chair likely to face questions on factors such as the interest rate path, inflation, and the economic growth outlook.
He is also expected to speak on the key takeaways of the Fed's Semi-Annual Federal Reserve Monetary Policy Report, published last Friday, highlighting modest further inflation progress this year.
Investors are particularly focused on Powell's stance regarding future rate cuts. Data recently showed a sharp rise in expectations for a September rate cut by the Fed, although some believe the first rate cut will arrive in December.
In a note to clients Tuesday, analysts at Macquarie said they believe Powell's tone will be dovish.
""Last week's FOMC Minutes already displayed a shift in the Fed's tone, toward caring more about the loosening labor market and softening activity indicator,"" they wrote. ""If Congress issues strong calls to have President Joe Biden abandon his candidacy, and if that raises the prospect that Donald Trump will win, it could raise US yields again.
""For good reasons, traders like to link Trump's policy agenda with inflation; they see policy rates being higher than otherwise under Trump 2.0, as we've discussed.""
As Powell takes the stand, markets will be closely monitoring his every word for clues about the Fed's future actions."
Bofa: Single stock inflows from clients hit record high last week,"BofA Securities said that last week its clients became net buyers of US equities for the first time in three weeks, with purchases totaling $6.1 billion, marking the fifth-largest inflow in history. 
Clients bought both single stocks and ETFs, with single stock inflows reaching the highest levels recorded since 2008, BofA highlighted.
All major client groups, including retail investors, hedge funds, and institutions, were net buyers. Institutional clients led the inflows, marking their largest since November 2022. Both large and small caps saw consistent inflows over the past five weeks, while mid-caps experienced outflows for the first time in five weeks.
Meanwhile, BofA corporate client buybacks slowed but remained above typical seasonal levels as a percentage of S&P 500 market cap for the 17th consecutive week. 
Sector-wise, clients purchased stocks across all sectors except Energy, with Technology leading for the fifth consecutive week and Discretionary experiencing the largest weekly inflow since 2008.
“Comm. Svcs. continues to have the longest buying streak (last 14 weeks) and Staples saw the 10th largest weekly inflow in our data history,” strategists at BofA Securities said.
BofA said its clients purchased equity ETFs for the fifth consecutive week, with inflows spanning eight of the eleven ETF sectors, led by Financials. Health Care ETFs, however, experienced the largest outflow."
"A 'deeper' S&P 500 pullback is coming, Piper Sandler warns","Piper Sandler analysts are cautioning investors about a potential correction in the S&P 500, despite recent highs. Their note highlights a weakening market that could lead to a significant pullback.
In today's note warning of a potential correction, Piper Sandler stated: ""Deteriorating market breadth and narrowing leadership"" are the key concerns.
This means that fewer stocks are participating in the rally, and investors are focusing on a limited group of high-performing companies. They argue that this undermines the sustainability of the current upswing.
However, it goes against a separate note from the firm this week that said its analysts believe Wall Street will remain bullish until unemployment reaches 4.5% and they remain constructive. Even so, they flagged that most market downturns occur from either higher rates or unemployment.
Nevertheless, Piper Sandler said its technical indicators also point towards a correction. Piper Sandler's ""40-week Technique indicator"" shows a low number of stocks trending positively, suggesting weaker market internals.
While the recent jobs report might lead to a Fed rate cut, Piper Sandler says other factors are concerning.
""The MID and RTY are below their 50-day MAs and poised for a leg lower toward their respective 200-day MAs,"" the firm states, indicating a potential decline in mid-cap and small-cap stocks.
Despite maintaining its year-end target, Piper Sandler expects a ""deeper pullback/correction in the coming months."" They believe the S&P 500 is overdue for a 10% correction towards its long-term uptrend. In conclusion, Piper Sandler advises investors to be cautious. The current market dynamics suggest a correction is likely, and investors should prioritize vigilance over complacency."
How to trade AI? Citi says take profits as sentiment is most elevated since 2019,"Citi analysts warned investors about potentially overheated sentiment in Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks.
Their note highlights how optimism surrounding AI stocks has reached its highest level since 2019, based on factors like market expectations and historical price movements.
""Sentiment around stocks with high exposure to AI is the most elevated it has been since 2019,"" states Citi.
This concern stems from a combination of factors. Firstly, Citi's estimates for future growth in these stocks are significantly lower than what market prices currently imply. Secondly, the recent price surge of AI stocks significantly outpaces historical growth trends. Finally, options market data suggests a potential imbalance towards bullish bets on AI.
Citi recommends capitalizing on this situation by taking profits on high-flying AI stocks, particularly those in the ""enabler"" category, such as semiconductor companies. ""We continue to suggest investors take profits in AI highfliers,"" advises Citi.
Investors can then reinvest these profits ""more broadly across the theme's value chain,"" creating a more balanced portfolio within the AI sector.
For those who are even more cautious about the AI market, Citi offers an alternative strategy: the AI Hedge Basket.
This basket is designed to benefit from a potential decline in AI stocks. ""We introduce the AI Hedge basket as an alternative to outright shorting,"" explains Citi. The basket prioritizes companies with negative correlations to high AI exposure stocks, offering a hedge against potential losses."

"NHTSA opens recall query into about 94,000 Jeep Wrangler 4xe SUVs","(Reuters) -The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened a recall query into 94,275 Stellantis-owned Jeep SUVs over a loss of motive power, the U.S. auto safety regulator said on Tuesday.
The investigation targets Jeep's Wrangler 4xe hybrid SUVs manufactured between 2021 through 2024. Chrysler had previously recalled the same model in 2022 to address concerns related to an engine shutdown.
A recall query is an investigation opened by safety regulators when a remedy to solve an issue appears inadequate.
The complaints noted in the new report include both failures in vehicles that received the recall remedy and those not covered by the prior recall, the NHTSA said.
Jeep sold a little over 67,000 electrified Wrangler's in the United States last year, representing 43% of total sales for the model."
Ex-FTX executives who testified against Bankman-Fried to be sentenced,"NEW YORK (Reuters) -Sentencing hearings have been scheduled for two former executives of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX who testified against founder Sam Bankman-Fried, court records showed on Tuesday. 
Nishad Singh will be sentenced on Oct. 30 and Gary Wang will be sentenced on Nov. 20 in Manhattan federal court. Each pleaded guilty to fraud. 
Bankman-Fried in March was sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted last year of stealing $8 billion from FTX customers, in what prosecutors called one of the largest financial frauds in U.S. history. 
Prosecutors are expected to ask U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan to take Singh’s and Wang’s cooperation into account when determining their punishments."
US stocks mostly higher; tech sector gains ahead of Powell's testimony,"Investing.com-- U.S. stocks mostly edged higher Tuesday as increased expectations for a September rate cut kept the tech sector buoyant before testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 
At 09:35 ET (13:35 GMT), Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 40 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 rose 10 points, or 0.2%, and NASDAQ Composite rose 75 points, or 0.4%. 
Powell testimony in focus
Powell is set to begin his two-day testimony before Congress, starting later Tuesday with the Senate before the House on Wednesday. 
The Fed Chair is expected to offer more cues on monetary policy, with markets watching for any dovish signals, especially in the wake of softer inflation and labor data in recent weeks. 
Beyond Powell’s testimony, several other Fed officials are also set to speak this week, including open markets committee members Michelle Bowman and Raphael Bostic.
Investors will also be looking to key consumer price index inflation data for June, which is due on Thursday, for more cues on the path of inflation. The Fed has repeatedly signaled that it needs more confidence that inflation is easing, before it can begin cutting interest rates.
The CME Fedwatch tool showed traders pricing in an over 70% chance for a 25 basis point cut in September, up from last week’s 59%. 
Confidence that rate cuts are coming shortly resulted in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite eking out record highs on Monday. 
Earnings season to begin with banks
Focus this week will also be on the second quarter earnings season, which is set to begin with results from several major banks at the end of the week. 
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) are set to report quarterly earnings on Friday.
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) are also on tap this week. 
Analysts, on average, see S&P 500 companies increasing their aggregate earnings per share by 10.1% in the second quarter, up from an 8.2% increase in the first quarter, according to LSEG I/B/E/S data.
Additionally, the likes of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to post gains, both rising over 2%, amid growing confidence in all things linked with artificial intelligence. 
Crude slips after Beryl passes
Crude prices edged lower Tuesday, after Hurricane Beryl caused less damage to a key U.S. oil-producing region than expected, easing concerns over supply disruption.
By 09:35 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) fell 0.2% to $82.14 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.2% to $85.56 a barrel.
Market participants are also keeping an eye on the situation in the Middle East, as hopes of a possible ceasefire deal in Gaza, potentially reducing worries about global crude supply disruption, hit crude prices on Monday.
The American Petroleum Institute releases its estimates of weekly crude inventories later in the session, with a draw expected given the summer driving season.

"Fisker to recall over 12,000 Ocean vehicles (June 28)","(Corrects paragraph 8 in June 28 story to say Fisker recalled thousands of cars earlier this month, not recalled more than 18,000 cars)
(Reuters) -Electric-vehicle firm Fisker is recalling more than 12,000 Ocean vehicles to fix an issue where exterior door handles can stick and fail to open, the company said on Friday, marking its third recall this month.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has four open investigations into a variety of issues related to the Ocean SUV that was meant to compete with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s best-selling Model Y crossover.
Once a high-flying EV startup, Fisker filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month after burning through cash in an attempt to ramp up production and deliver its Ocean SUVs.
""A door that fails to open can prevent occupants from exiting in an emergency, increasing the risk of injury,"" the regulator said, adding that the company will replace the faulty door handles free of charge.
Fisker in a notice asked its dealers in the United States, Canada and Europe to stop sales of the Ocean vehicles in inventory and inspect for the issue.
The company said in a statement 8,204 Ocean SUVs in the United States, 513 in Canada and 3,806 in Europe were being recalled, taking the total figure to 12,523 units.
Customers have complained widely on social media platforms of issues regarding the key fob not unlocking the car at times and the door failing to open.
Earlier this month, Fisker recalled thousands of cars in North America and Europe due to faulty software and non-compliance with safety standards.
Fisker is the second automaker by famed car designer Henrik Fisker to file for bankruptcy protection. The first outfit, Fisker Automotive (OTC:FSRNQ), filed for bankruptcy in 2013 after a battery failure in its Karma plug-in hybrid electric vehicle resulted in a recall and substantial associated costs."
Dollar gains before Fed's Powell testimony,"By Karen Brettell
(Reuters) - The U.S. dollar gained on Tuesday before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony before Congress, with investors looking for any fresh clues on potential interest rate cuts as data points to a slowing economy.
Powell may offer a more dovish take on the economy as the labor market softens and inflation recedes closer to the Fed’s 2% annual target. 
Fed officials projected only one rate cut this year in their “dot plot” of interest rate expectations at the U.S. central bank’s June meeting. 
This followed hotter than expected inflation in the first quarter, and was down from expectations of three cuts this year in March.
On Tuesday Powell is likely to acknowledge that the ""dot plot"" is becoming more dated, said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York.
He will also likely indicate that ""incoming data has been boosting the Fed's confidence that the economy is slowing and that inflation is headed back towards its target”, Chandler added. 
Traders have boosted bets since Friday’s jobs report that the Fed will cut twice by December, with the first reduction likely in September.
This week’s main U.S. economic focus will be Thursday’s consumer price index for June, which is expected to show that headline prices rose 0.1% on the month, while core prices gained 0.2%. That would put annual gains at 3.1% and 3.4%, respectively.
The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against the euro, sterling, yen and three other major rivals, was last up 0.11% at 105.08. It fell to 104.80 on Monday, the lowest since June 13.
The euro dipped after Monday's sharp swings as investors came to terms with a hung parliament in France, which points to a potential political gridlock but lessens fiscal concerns stemming from outright far-right or leftist victories.
French political leaders from the left-wing bloc that came first in Sunday's legislative election said they intended to govern according to their tax-and-spend program, but centrists laid claim to a role as the left lacks a majority.
The single currency was last down 0.07% at $1.0814. It reached $1.0845 on Monday, the highest since June 12.
The European Central Bank can continue to gradually reduce interest rates without jeopardizing a current fall in inflation, governing council member Fabio Panetta said on Tuesday.
The ECB cut rates for the first time in June from their record highs, but has made no explicit commitment on a follow-up move.
The dollar strengthened 0.19% to 161.11 Japanese yen. It is holding below a 38-year high of 161.96 reached last week.
Some market players called on the Bank of Japan to slow its bond buying to roughly half the current pace under a scheduled tapering plan due out this month, the central bank said on Tuesday.
Sterling strengthened 0.02% to $1.2806.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin gained 1.95% to $57,358."
