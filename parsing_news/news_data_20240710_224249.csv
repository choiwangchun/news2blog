US stocks edge higher; Powell set to testify to House,"Investing.com-- U.S. stocks edged marginally higher Wednesday, continuing to gain ahead of more comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell .
At 06:45 ET (10:45 GMT), Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 26 points, or 0.1%, higher, S&P 500 gained 11 points, or 0.2%, and NASDAQ Composite rose 70 points, or 0.4%. 
The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite both closed at record levels on Tuesday, with gains largely biased towards heavyweight technology stocks, amid persistent hype over artificial intelligence.  
Powell takes to the stage again 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell continues his two-day testimony in front of Congress later in the session, this time speaking before the House of Representatives.
Speaking before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Powell acknowledged that the U.S. economy had cooled in recent months, and was also making progress towards the Fed’s 2% inflation target.
Powell noted that too much cooling in the labor market presented another risk to the economy, and that keeping interest rates too high for too long could present more headwinds to the economy. 
Still, the Fed Chair did not provide any direct cues on the timing of any potential interest rate cuts, and reiterated that any future decisions will remain contingent on upcoming economic data. He also reiterated the bank’s commitment to meeting its 2% inflation target. 
The Fed Chair’s comments saw traders largely maintain bets on a September rate cut, with CME Fedwatch showing an over 72% chance for a 25 basis point cut during the month. 
Powell’s comments also put upcoming consumer price index inflation data, due Thursday, squarely in focus. 
Microsoft to give up Open AI board seat - report 
In the corporate sector, a slew of major Wall Street banks are set to report on Friday, while numbers from PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) are also scheduled before the end of the week.. 
Aside from this, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock slipped marginally after the software giant is reportedly set to relinquish its observer seat on the OpenAI board amid increasing regulatory scrutiny over generative AI in Europe and the U.S..
Keith Dolliver, Microsoft’s Deputy General Counsel, wrote to OpenAI on Tuesday, stating that while the observer seat provided valuable insights into the board’s activities without compromising its independence, it was no longer necessary, given that Microsoft had “witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board.”
Crude slips on weak Chinese data  
Crude prices fell Wednesday, adding to the previous session’s losses as weak Chinese inflation data raised concerns about the health of the second largest economy in the world.
By 09:35 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) dropped 0.2% to $81.29 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $84.40 a barrel.
Concerns over deflation in China, the world’s largest importer of crude,  weighed on the oil market Wednesday, although a bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. inventories has limited the losses. 
Data from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, showed that U.S. oil inventories fell 1.9 million barrels last week, as the summer driving season continued.
Both benchmarks lost about 3% in the previous three sessions on signs that the Texas energy industry came off relatively unscathed from Hurricane Beryl.

Big Tech stock targets raised at TD Cowen ahead of Q2 earnings,"TD Cowen lifted their stock price targets for Big Tech companies as Wall Street braces for the start of the Q2 earnings season.
The bank’s analysts have set a new price target of $245 for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), up from the previous $225, reflecting their expectation of a strong Q2 performance. 
The analysts forecast Q2 revenue of $150.2 billion, an 11.8% year-over-year increase, driven by a 16.6% growth in AWS revenue and a 22.0% surge in advertising revenue. 
“Our 2Q24 Op Income forecast of $15.2BN, +98% y/y, is 20% above consensus given ramping gross profits, opex efficiencies and a benefit from extended server lives,” analysts said in a note. 
For Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), analysts have increased their price target from $130 to $145, based on strong growth across its segments. 
The analysts expect Q2 revenue of $85.5 billion, a 13.3% year-over-year increase. This growth is primarily driven by a 12.5% rise in Google Services revenue, bolstered by continued strength in search and YouTube, and a 27.2% increase in Google Cloud revenue. 
“Our 2Q Digital ad expert check call on 7/8 suggests GOOG Search spend growth remained robust in 2Q24, implying a healthy Digital ad environment. Meanwhile, our survey data suggests YouTube is still gaining share among younger viewers,” the note states.
Lastly, TD Cowen's new price target for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is $600, up from the previous target of $530. 
The upward revision reflects analysts’ optimism about the company's long-term growth driven by AI initiatives. 
They expect Meta's Q2 revenue to reach $38.6 billion, a 20.6% year-over-year increase and 1% above consensus estimates.
TD Cowen highlighted that the company’s AI focus is fueling growth across the board, primarily engagement growth “supported by Reels/Video and AI recommendations.” Moreover, monetization is boosted by AI-led ad ranking and campaigns, particularly through the Advantage Plus campaign suite, while the rollout of new AI messaging tools in Q2 2024 is likely to attract more advertisers to Meta's platforms.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/big-tech-stock-targets-raised-at-td-cowen-ahead-of-q2-earnings-432SI-3513767

"XAU/USD: Citi expects physical gold demand to rebound, maintains $3,000 target","Physical gold demand likely softened in the second quarter compared to the first, although “off a very strong base,” Citi analysts said in a Tuesday note.
The Wall Street behemoth notes that underlying gold consumption growth is still trending positively for 2024, potentially driving spot trading towards a record average price range of $2,400-$2,600 per ounce in the second half of the year “as financial investors play catch-up.”
Non-monetary gold imports into China decreased to a robust 137 tons per month in the second quarter from an unprecedented 189 tons per month in the first quarter. Citi continues to project a record 1,750 tons of onshore bullion imports in 2024, marking an 18% year-on-year increase and an eightfold rise from the 2020 pandemic levels.
""If our assessment is accurate, Chinese retail gold imports would represent 47% of world gold mine output in 2024, versus a 2021-2023 average of 34% and a 2017-2019 average of 36%,"" the analysts state.
Meanwhile, official sector gold demand has stabilized at a record 28-30% of gold mine production since 2022, with the potential to increase towards 35% in a bull case scenario over the next year due to trade wars and concerns about US fiscal policies, Citi said.
Analysts model a record ~1,100 tons of central bank gold buying in 2024, a 5.8% year-on-year increase, with the possibility of exceeding 1,250 tons in a bullish scenario.
Moreover, inflows into gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) should also improve in the second half of the year as the Federal Reserve begins its rate-cutting cycle, Citi added.
""We remain constructive on gold physical uptake over the next 12 months with a potential Fed cutting cycle and US labor market headwinds buttressing paper demand for the yellow metal,"" the bank's analysts wrote.
Their base case price targets for gold are $2,800-$3,000 per ounce by mid-2025, representing a 10-20% increase versus the forwards.",https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/xauusd-citi-expects-physical-gold-demand-to-rebound-maintains-3000-target-3513535
Honeywell to buy Air Products' LNG unit for $1.81 billion as deal-making spree continues,"(Reuters) -Honeywell said on Wednesday it would buy Air Products (NYSE:APD)' liquefied natural-gas process technology and equipment business for $1.81 billion in cash, marking the industrial giant's fourth acquisition this year.
The deal would complement Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON)'s LNG pretreatment business by adding technologies such as heat exchangers and cryogenic equipment to its portfolio amid growing demand for the fuel in key end-markets including power and data centers.
The Energy Information Administration this week forecast average U.S. LNG exports would reach 12.2 billion cubic feet per day in 2024 and 14.3 bcfd in 2025, up from a record 11.9 bcfd in 2023.
Air Products' cryogenic equipment and natural gas liquefaction processes are used both onshore and offshore to help cater the booming LNG market.
Its coil-wound heat exchangers, a part of the business being bought by Honeywell, is used for reliable liquefaction with minimal deck space requirement.
""Air Products' coil-wound heat exchangers technology will immediately expand our installed base,"" Vimal Kapur, CEO of Honeywell, said.
Since taking charge in June 2023, Kapur has steered Honeywell toward three ""compelling mega trends"" — automation, the future of aviation and energy transition.
Last month, Honeywell announced a deal to buy aerospace and defense technology provider CAES Systems for $1.9 billion.
The deal with Air Products, expected to close before the end of the calendar year, is likely to boost Honeywell's adjusted earnings per share in the first full year of ownership.
The transaction will create opportunities for growth in aftermarket services as well as digitalization through Honeywell's Forge platform.
Honeywell, which has a market capitalization of more than $137 billion, supplies products, software and services to various sectors, including construction, aerospace and industrial applications.

Oil steadies as OPEC keeps demand forecasts unchanged,"By Ahmad Ghaddar
LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices steadied on Wednesday as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) kept its growth forecast for oil demand unchanged for this year and next, while U.S. crude and gasoline inventories likely fell last week.
Brent futures were down 11 cents, or 0.1%, at $84.55 a barrel at 1212 GMT, after falling 1.3% in the previous session. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 7 cents, or 0.1%, to $81.34 a barrel, after falling 1.1% in the previous session.
OPEC maintained its 2024 and 2025 global oil demand growth forecasts at 2.25 million barrels per day (bpd) and 1.85 million bpd, respectively, it said in a monthly report on Wednesday.
U.S. crude oil fell by 1.923 million barrels and gasoline inventories by 2.954 million barrels, according to market sources, who cited American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday. [API/S] 
Official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration will be released at 1430 GMT. [EIA/S]
Both contracts ended the previous three sessions lower on signs that the Texas energy industry came off relatively unscathed from Hurricane Beryl. 
Oil and gas companies restarted some operations on Tuesday. Some ports have reopened and most producers were ramping up output, although some facilities sustained damage and awaited full restoration of power.
""The latest bout of selling can be attributed to two major factors: the potential revival of truce talks between Israel and Hamas and Hurricane Beryl,"" PVM Oil analyst Tamas Varga said.
In the Middle East, negotiations to secure a ceasefire in the Gaza war will resume in Doha, with the intelligence chiefs of Egypt, the United States and Israel in attendance.
Concerns over demand in China also weighed on prices as consumer prices in the world's second-largest economy grew for a fifth straight month in June but missed expectations, while producer price deflation persisted.

China announces more short-selling curbs to stabilise stocks,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's securities regulator on Wednesday announced more curbs on short-selling and pledged tighter scrutiny of computer-driven programme trading in its latest effort to bolster a flagging stock market.
Short-selling, involving the sale of borrowed shares, is often blamed in China by regulators and investors for exacerbating market declines.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said securities re-lending - in which brokers borrow shares for clients to short sell - would be suspended. In addition, margin requirements would be raised for short-sellers.
The CSRC also urged stock exchanges to publish detailed rules to regulate programme trading, especially high-frequency trading.
The new measures come after seven straight weeks of losses for China's blue-chip CSI300 index amid concerns over the health of the country's economy.
China has taken a series of measures to discourage short-selling since last August, and the latest moves are ""in response to investor concerns, and aimed at stabilising the market,"" the CSRC said in a statement.
The latest curbs are ""timely, and will help boost market sentiment,"" said Yang Delong, chief economist at First Seafront Fund Management Co.
New securities re-lending will be suspended from Thursday, while existing contracts must lapse by the end of September, the regulator said.
Meanwhile, stock exchanges will raise the minimum margin requirement ratio to 100% from 80% for short-selling, the CSRC said, adding the bar would be higher for hedge funds.
The regulator, which launched a crackdown on computer-driven quant funds early this year, said it would further restrict high-frequency trading to ensure a fair market. 
High-frequency trading accounts have slumped more than one fifth so far this year to about 1,600 at the end of June, according to the watchdog.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/chinese-regulator-to-suspend-securities-relending-to-curb-short-selling-3513337
"US, Mexico move to thwart China circumvention of US steel, aluminum tariffs","By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. and Mexico on Wednesday announced new steps to fight the circumvention of U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum by China and other countries that ship products through Mexico, implementing a North American ""melted and poured"" standard for steel.
The White House said that under a new policy implemented by President Joe Biden, steel product imports from Mexico will be subject to 25% U.S. ""Section 232"" tariffs unless the steel is documented to have been melted and poured in Mexico, the U.S. or Canada.
Similarly, for aluminum product imports from Mexico to escape the 10% Section 232 tariffs, they must not contain primary aluminum that is smelt or cast in China, Russia, Belarus or Iran.
Importers of the products into the U.S. will need to provide a certificate of analysis to U.S. Customs and Border Protection showing the country of origin for the metals, Biden administration officials said. 
Mexico has agreed to require importers of steel products across its borders to provide more information on the country of origin of these products, Biden and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said in a joint statement.
""Both countries will implement policies to jointly prevent tariff evasion on steel and aluminum, and strengthen North American steel and aluminum supply chains,"" the presidents said in the statement released by the White House.
Biden has courted the votes of union members and particularly the United Steelworkers in his bid for re-election in November, opposing a takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel of Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel. 
BACK DOOR
The new import requirements come amid increasing concerns about China's excess industrial capacity flooding global markets with exports amid weak domestic demand. It comes after Biden in May hiked tariffs on a broad array of strategic goods from China, including steel and aluminum, electric vehicles, batteries, semiconductors and critical minerals.
But U.S. officials have grown increasingly concerned that Mexico could become a back door for China into the U.S. market, taking advantage of Mexico's duty-free access through the North American trade pact.
Reuters reported in April that the U.S. officials cautioned their Mexican counterparts against offering incentives to Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers that were scouting out potential factory sites in Mexico.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai described Wednesday's action as ""fixing a loophole"" left by the Trump administration, which imposed the Section 232 tariffs in 2018.
Metal found to have Chinese origin would also be subject to 25% Section 301 duties, a rate increased by Biden in May.
Volumes of steel imports from Mexico originating elsewhere were small in 2023, making up only about 13% of the 3.8 million tons of steel imported from Mexico, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. But a Biden administration official said the new requirements were ""forward-looking,"" meant to head off an expected surge of imports as China's steel-consuming sectors such as real estate struggle.
The American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry group, applauded the step to close off an avenue for Chinese steel into the U.S. market, but said its effectiveness depended on Mexico providing accurate information on the metals that it imports.
""We urge the U.S. government to continue to press for additional actions to address the many schemes by steel traders to circumvent and evade U.S. trade laws, and to ensure this new arrangement is vigorously and fully enforced,"" the group said.
Biden and Lopez Obrador in their statement pledged more U.S.-Mexico cooperation in coming weeks and months ""to protect the North American steel and aluminum markets from unfair trade practices.""
Lopez Obrador's successor, President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum, takes office on Oct. 1 but has begun to name her cabinet.",https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/us-mexico-move-to-thwart-china-circumvention-of-us-steel-aluminum-tariffs-3513743
Argentina rolls out aviation reform in bid to bring in foreign airlines,"By Kylie Madry
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The Argentine government published a sweeping decree on Wednesday aimed at opening up the country's aviation sector, inviting foreign airlines to enter the market long dominated by state-run carrier Aerolineas Argentinas.
The reform should boost the number of routes, flight frequencies and bring in more competitors, the transportation secretariat said in a statement.
Carriers can now petition to operate as many routes and frequencies as they want, subject to safety approval, according to the decree. 
Airlines also now have full control over how much they charge for tickets, the decree states, doing away with a dormant regulation which allowed the government to set a price floor.
The administration of libertarian President Javier Milei, who took office in December, has tied up a number of ""open-skies agreements"" with other countries in recent months, allowing their airlines to operate domestic routes in Argentina under some conditions.
Brazil, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, Uruguay and Canada have all signed agreements so far, potentially opening up the Argentine market to carriers from Gol to LATAM to Air Canada.
The transportation secretariat said on Wednesday that more such agreements should be signed in coming months.
Aerolineas Argentinas operated 62% of domestic flights in May, according to the most recent regulator data available. Trailing behind it were local low-cost airline Flybondi with 26% of the domestic market and Chilean carrier Jetsmart with 11%.
The state-run carrier's future remains uncertain as Milei has previously said he will privatize the airline. However, a bid to do so was scrapped from an omnibus reform bill passed by Congress last month.
Milei's spokesman, Manuel Adorni, said in an interview published last week by a local outlet that the government may try to make some state-run companies, such as Aerolineas, more profitable before looking to privatize them or seek out a buyer.
Last year, Aerolineas turned a $32 million net profit, according to the company.
Unions have heavily criticized the industry reforms, arguing that the government is hurting Aerolineas' operations and employees in order to bring in low-cost competitors.
Aerolineas has cut some frequencies and trimmed its workforce in recent months, according to the unions.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/argentina-rolls-out-aviation-reform-in-bid-to-bring-in-foreign-airlines-3513758
Morgan Stanley bullish on Tesla's energy storage segment,"By Medha Singh
(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley raised its valuation for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s energy storage business, expecting a global surge in demand for power driven by the artificial-intelligence boom, and the company's ability to grow its market share in the segment.
The brokerage lifted the value of the unit at $50 per share of its $310 price target, up from its previous estimate of $36 apiece, while reducing its forecast for Tesla's 2030 auto sales. 
It estimates that the profit generated from a fully utilized megafactory, which manufactures large-storage batteries, is equal to that from selling 1 million Tesla vehicles.
""It's no wonder that investors are starting to consider the real possibility that Tesla Energy may be worth more than Tesla Auto,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said.
Tesla shares have surged nearly 44% in the past 10 sessions, their longest streak in more than a year, after a dour start to the year. 
The daily trading turnover for Tesla shares overtook AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) last week for the first time in six months, per LSEG data.
Oppenheimer said in a note on Tuesday it expects to see Tesla's energy storage sales to surpass $3 billion in the current quarter, but added that ""the value of its full-self driving /AI platform is the key to whether shares will continue moving higher or begin to moderate again.""
In April, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla would likely launch full-self driving software this year, which would be a big profit generator.
Tesla deployed 9.4 gigawatt hours of energy storage products in the second quarter of 2024, more than double of that in the January-March period. 
Its products include the Powerwall home power backup system, and Megapack, meant for large-scale commercial projects and utilities.
Energy storage and generation accounted for 6% of Tesla's 2023 revenue, and the rest came from the auto segment, according to LSEG data.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/morgan-stanley-bullish-on-teslas-energy-storage-segment-3513742
