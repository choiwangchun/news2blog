What happens to solar stocks if Trump wins? RBC weighs in,"As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, the potential impact on solar stocks is becoming a key concern for investors, according to RBC Capital. 
Analysts at the bank provided a detailed analysis, suggesting that the current environment might offer a buying opportunity, especially for select names less exposed to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) or those that could benefit from protectionist policies under a Republican administration.
Year-to-date, clean energy stocks have underperformed, with the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (NYSE:XLE) (ICLN) down approximately 13%, underperforming the S&P 500 by 29%. RBC notes that this downturn intensified following the presidential debate, which saw a surge in Republican support. 
The bank says that the prospect of a Republican victory has raised concerns about the future of the IRA, though its analysts believe a full repeal is unlikely due to bipartisan support for job-creating benefits in non-Democratic districts. Nonetheless, the uncertainty around potential partial repeals remains a concern.
RBC highlights that domestic manufacturers like First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) might benefit from increased protectionist policies. In contrast, they note that companies dependent on foreign imports, such as Enphase (ENPH), Shoals (SHLS), and SolarEdge (NASDAQ:SEDG), could face challenges due to higher input costs from tariffs. The Biden administration's approach has favored incentives over tariffs, benefiting companies reliant on cheaper imports.
While a Republican administration might introduce headwinds and increased volatility, RBC sees robust state-level support driven by renewable energy requirements.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/what-happens-to-solar-stocks-if-trump-wins-rbc-weighs-in-432SI-3518111

"Colorado reports three presumptive human bird flu cases, CDC says","By Julie Steenhuysen
(Reuters) -Colorado has reported three presumptive cases of H5 bird flu virus infection in poultry workers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday.
The three people experienced mild symptoms, the CDC said in a statement. The infections occurred in workers who were culling infected animals at a poultry facility that was experiencing an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu, it said.
The symptoms included conjunctivitis, or pink eye, and common respiratory infection symptoms, Colorado officials said in a statement, adding that none of the people were hospitalized.
State epidemiologists said the infections appear to have occurred through contact with infected poultry.
The CDC said it is sending a team to Colorado to support an investigation and that the risk to the general public remains low.
Human infections with H5N1 avian flu are concerning because of the potential to cause severe disease and possibly spark a pandemic if the virus were to change and acquire the ability to spread easily from person to person, the CDC said.
The cases are part of a far-reaching outbreak of H5N1 bird flu that has been spreading globally in wild birds, infecting poultry and various species of mammals and causing an outbreak in U.S. dairy cows.
""There are no signs of unexpected increases in flu activity otherwise in Colorado, or in other states affected by H5 bird flu outbreaks in cows and poultry,"" the CDC said.
Preliminary testing by Colorado officials showed the three were infected with a novel type of influenza and are presumed to have bird flu. Samples have been sent to the CDC for confirmatory testing. 
If positive, they would represent the fourth case of bird flu in Colorado and the seventh U.S. case of the virus since March.
The CDC said findings from their investigation will inform whether guidance changes are needed. An analysis of the virus sequences from this outbreak also will be important to determine if a change in the risk assessment is warranted. 
The CDC said its recommendations with regard to H5N1 remain unchanged and urged people to avoid close, prolonged or unprotected exposure to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals, including cows.
People should also avoid unprotected exposures to animal feces, litter, unpasteurized or raw milk, or materials that have been near or touched by animals with suspected or confirmed bird flu, it said.",https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/colorado-reports-three-presumptive-human-bird-flu-cases-cdc-says-3518105
"Musk donates to group working to elect Trump, Bloomberg reports","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Billionaire Elon Musk, who has been ramping up criticism of U.S. President Joe Biden, has donated to a political group working to elect rival presidential candidate Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing sources.
The report did not indicate how much Musk donated but added it was ""a sizable amount"" given to a group called America PAC. 
Bloomberg reported that the PAC - a group that can receive unlimited contributions for political activity - is next required to disclose its list of donors on July 15.
In March, Trump, a former U.S. President who is expected to be formally nominated next week as the Republican Party's candidate for the Nov. 5 election, met with Musk and other wealthy donors.
In response to reports of the meeting, South Africa-born Musk posted on X: ""Just to be super clear, I am not donating money to either candidate for US President."" In May, he also denied media reports that there had been talks over a potential advisory role for him in any Trump presidency. 
Musk, the world's richest person who runs electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), rocket maker SpaceX, social media company X and other companies, did not respond to Reuters' request for comments. 
Biden campaign spokesman James Singer said that Musk knows Trump is ""a sucker who will sell America out, cutting his taxes while raising taxes on the middle class by $2,500.""
""Joe Biden has been standing up to people like Elon and fighting for the middle class his entire career — and it’s why he’ll win in November,"" Singer said in a statement.
Musk in recent years has more fully embraced the Republican Party, which has weighed on the reputation and sales of Tesla, the biggest source of his wealth. 
Trump last month reiterated his pledge to immediately abandon the Biden administration's ""mandate"" to support the electric vehicle industry. But he added: ""I'm a big fan of electric cars. I'm a fan of Elon.""
""He does an incredible job with Tesla."" 
Musk said they had ""some conversations"" and Trump is a ""huge fan of the Cybertrucks,"" referring to Tesla's electric pickup trucks. 
While he has publicly criticized Biden's policies on immigration and electric vehicles and even his age, Musk has not made any formal endorsement in November's contest and Trump has said he did not know if he has Musk's support.
He has also endorsed antisemitic comments on X, though Musk has denied being antisemitic.
Musk's views have hurt his standing among some consumers, according to a CivicScience survey shown exclusively to Reuters.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/musk-donates-to-super-pac-working-to-elect-trump-bloomberg-reports-3518057
"Alec Baldwin ""Rust"" shooting case dismissed over withheld evidence","By Andrew Hay
SANTA FE, New Mexico (Reuters) -A New Mexico judge dismissed involuntary manslaughter charges against Alec Baldwin on Friday, agreeing with his lawyers that prosecutors and police withheld evidence on the source of the live round that killed ""Rust"" cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in 2021.
Three days after Baldwin's trial began, New Mexico district court Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer threw out the case as the actors' lawyers alleged a ""cover up"" by prosecutors who have been plagued by missteps since first filing charges 18 months ago.
Breaking down in tears, the multiple Emmy-award winning actor hugged his wife Hilaria Baldwin as other family members wept in the public gallery.
Baldwin faced an unprecedented criminal prosecution as an actor for an on-set shooting and his lawyers said prosecutors dragged him through a ""cesspool of improprieties."" Baldwin and his family left court without speaking to reporters.
""The state's withholding of the evidence was wilful and deliberate,"" Sommer said in delivering her decision. ""Dismissal with prejudice is warranted to ensure the integrity of the judicial system and the efficient administration of justice.""
The actor's lawyer Alex Spiro told the court that the Santa Fe sheriff's office took possession of live rounds in March as evidence in the case but failed to list them in the ""Rust"" investigation file or disclose their existence to defense lawyers.
""The real reason you didn't inventory that evidence is because it could have jeopardized the law enforcement case,"" Spiro told Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office Corporal Alexandria Hancock, the lead investigator on the ""Rust"" case, in cross examination on Friday.
Erlinda Johnson, one of the state prosecutors on the case, resigned on Friday, the fourth prosecutor to quit or be forced to step down. 
""I did not intend to mislead the court,"" lead state prosecutor Kari Morrissey said after taking the unusual step of defending herself from the witness stand. ""My understanding of what was dropped off at the sheriff's office is on this computer screen and it looks absolutely nothing like the live rounds from the set of Rust.""
Many legal analysts said the case should never have been brought to trial by the Santa Fe County District Attorney's Office. ""The prosecution felt it had to cheat to get the result it wanted,"" said legal analyst Duncan Levin, a New York defense attorney. ""This is the worst of our system on display."" 
Hutchins died in Hollywood's first on-set shooting in nearly 30 years when Baldwin was directed to point a revolver at her as she set up a camera shot during filming southwest of Santa Fe. The weapon fired a .45 caliber round inadvertently loaded by the movie's armorer Hannah Gutierrez. 
The Colt .45 rounds at the center of the dismissal were handed into the sheriff's office on March 6 by Troy Teske, a friend of Thell Reed, the stepfather of Gutierrez, on the same day she was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for Hutchins' death.
A sheriff's office crime scene technician, Marissa Poppel, testified on Thursday that the rounds did not match those collected on the set of Rust which were sent for FBI testing.
But when defense lawyers inspected them they found some had brass casings with the “Starline Brass” logo and silver, nickel primers, just like the six live rounds found on the set of Rust. Others looked like inert dummy rounds taken into evidence on the set.
“That turned out to be completely false, didn’t it?” Baldwin's lawyer Spiro asked Corporal Hancock.
“You’re correct,” she said.
Judge Sommer asked Hancock who had decided to put Teske’s ammunition into a separate case file number.
Hancock said it was the decision of her supervisor, prosecutors and herself.
“Ms. Morrissey was part of that conversation?” asked Sommer, growing visibly angry.
“Yes,” replied Hancock.
Spiro also questioned Morrissey about her attitude toward his client, saying witnesses had reported she had characterized him with expletives and said she would try to teach him a lesson.
""I never said to witnesses that I would teach him a lesson,"" she said.
Prosecutors had alleged Baldwin played a role in the death of Hutchins because he handled the gun irresponsibly. His lawyers said Baldwin was failed by Gutierrez and others responsible for safety on the set, and law enforcement agents were more interested in prosecuting their client than finding the source of the live round that killed Hutchins.
Defense lawyers alleged prop supplier Seth Kenney supplied the live rounds to ""Rust,"" an accusation he denied in testimony on Friday.
It remains to be seen whether the dismissal of Baldwin's case would affect Gutierrez's conviction, which is under appeal.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/judge-sends-jury-home-after-alec-baldwin-seeks-dismissal-of-charge-3517786
Court upholds Tennessee ban on changing sex in birth certificates,"By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - A divided federal appeals court on Friday rejected a constitutional challenge to Tennessee's decades-old policy of not allowing people born in the state to amend their birth certificates to reflect their gender identity.
A 2-1 panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the U.S. Constitution did not require the Republican-led state to change the biological sex listed on the birth certificates of four transgender women born in Tennessee.
The state is among only a handful nationally that categorically bars individuals from amending the sex on their birth certificates.
The transgender women argued Tennessee's policy violated their due process rights and infringed on equal protection rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment by discriminating on the basis of their sex and transgender status.
But Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Jeffrey Sutton, writing for the majority, concluded that a lower-court judge rightly rejected the lawsuit, saying there was no fundamental right to a birth certificate recording gender identity instead of biological sex. 
""The States have considerable discretion in defining the terms used in their own laws and in deciding what records to keep,"" he wrote. ""Tennessee did not exceed that discretion in distinguishing biological sex from gender identity in its birth certificate records.""
Tennessee's Republican attorney general, Jonathan Skrmetti, welcomed the ruling, saying ""any change in Tennessee's policy can only come from the people of Tennessee.""
Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at the LGBTQ rights group Lambda Legal, said they were disappointed and considering their options. ""Nobody is harmed by our plaintiffs having birth certificates reflecting who they are,"" he said.
Gonzalez-Pagan said the ruling conflicted with a decision last month by the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that revived a lawsuit challenging an Oklahoma policy prohibiting transgender people from changing their birth certificates to match their gender identity.
Both judges in the 6th Circuit ruling's majority were appointed by Republican presidents while the dissenting judge, Helene White, was initially nominated by Democratic former President Bill Clinton before ultimately being appointed by his Republican successor, George W. Bush.
White said the policy was based on generalizations of what it meant to be male and female and infringed the plaintiffs rights because it ""forcibly outs them in the myriad circumstances when birth certificates are necessary to participate fully in contemporary society.""",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/court-upholds-tennessee-ban-on-changing-sex-in-birth-certificates-3518099
Ecuador court sentences five people for up to 34 years in candidate murder,"By Alexandra Valencia
QUITO (Reuters) -A court in Ecuador on Friday handed down prison sentences of 12 years and 34 years for five people found guilty of murdering presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio.
Journalist and former legislator Villavicencio was shot while leaving a rally in August 2023, becoming the most prominent victim of Ecuador's spiraling violence.
The ruling, read out by Milton Maroto, one of the court's three judges, can be appealed by both the prosecution and the defense. The trial started at the end of June.
Prosecutors accused at least two of those tried of belonging to the Los Lobos crime gang, among 22 criminal gangs designated as terrorists by President Daniel Noboa in January.
According to the attorney general's office, Carlos Edwin Angulo Lara, known as 'El Invisible' ('The Invisible'), gave the order to murder Villavicencio from prison, while Laura Dayanara Castillo was in charge of logistics.
Both Angulo and Castillo were sentenced to 34 years and eight months.
Erick Ramirez, Victor Flores and Alexandra Chimbo were sentenced to 12 years.
Villavicencio, whose journalism exposed corruption and connections between organized crime and politicians, had long faced threats.
Prosecutors are undertaking a separate investigation into who requested the murder. 
One of the hit men died at the scene of Villavicencio's murder and seven other suspects - mostly Colombian citizens - were murdered in October while being held in prisons on pre-trial detention. 
Villavicencio's friends and family have decried multiple delays and urged investigation into who ordered the killing.
Veronica Sarauz, Villavicencio's widow, had asked judges earlier on Friday in a post on X to apply the full weight of the law to those accused.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/ecuador-court-sentences-five-people-for-up-to-34-years-in-candidate-murder-3518068
Vietnam's VinFast delays US electric car plant amid market slowdown,"By Phuong Nguyen
HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnamese electric vehicle (EV) maker VinFast (NASDAQ:VFS) is delaying the launch of its planned $4 billion factory in North Carolina to 2028 and cutting its delivery forecast for this year by 20,000 units amid uncertainties in the global EV market.
VinFast, founded by Vietnam's richest man Pham Nhat Vuong in 2017 and which turned to making fully electric vehicles in 2022, said it would now deliver 80,000 vehicles this year, down from the initially planned 100,000. 
Sales at the Vietnamese EV maker rose 24% to about 12,000 vehicles in the second quarter, compared with the previous three-month period. In total, VinFast sold 21,747 units in the first half of 2024, an increase of 92% against the same period last year, but around one-fourth of the new yearly forecast. 
""While the second-quarter delivery results were encouraging, ongoing economic headwinds and uncertainties in different macro-economies and (the) global EV landscape necessitate a more prudent outlook for the rest of the year,"" VinFast said in a statement on Saturday.
The EV maker still expects strong sales growth in the second half of the year, driven by a diverse product range and expansion in key regions, including new markets in Asia and existing markets.
In its statement, VinFast said it would delay the launch of its planned factory in North Carolina to 2028 from the current plan of 2025. Reuters had reported a possible delay in May, citing a person briefed on the matter. 
VinFast had announced in 2022 that it would build an EV and battery factory in the United States with an annual production capacity of 150,000 vehicles, seeking to take advantage of the Biden administration's efforts to approve subsidies for EVs made in America.
However, demand for EVs has faltered amid high borrowing costs and as buyers turn to cheaper gasoline-electric hybrids, forcing many automakers to reassess their plans for new factories and models.
""This decision will allow the company to optimize its capital allocation and manage its short-term spending more effectively, focusing more resources on supporting near-term growth targets and strengthening existing operations,"" VinFast said.
""The adjustment doesn't change VinFast's fundamental growth strategy and key operating targets.""
VinFast, which has yet to make a profit, logged a net loss of $618 million in the first quarter. Revenue for the period nearly tripled from a year earlier but tumbled 31% from the previous three months. 
The company is set to announce its second-quarter results on Aug. 15.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/vietnams-vinfast-delays-us-electric-car-plant-amid-market-slowdown-3518100
South Korea's SK On in talks to supply prismatic EV batteries as it seeks turnaround,"By Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean EV battery maker SK On is in talks with automakers to supply prismatic batteries, expanding from its existing pouch-type batteries, a senior executive said, as it scrambles to turn around amid slowing global electric vehicle (EV) demand. 
SK On, a unit of energy group SK Innovation, which supplies EV batteries to Ford Motor (NYSE:F), Hyundai Motor (OTC:HYMTF), Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) among others, is speaking to multiple automakers that are looking to line up prismatic battery supply deals, SK On chief spokesperson Ko Chang-Kook said.
""We are having talks with automakers who will take our prismatic batteries ... we will now have the opportunity to diversify our product portfolios sooner than later,"" Ko told Reuters.
Ko did not disclose the names of automakers but said the company has already completed the prismatic battery technology and is prepared to start producing prismatic batteries once discussions are finalized. 
There are three types of lithium-ion batteries currently used in EVs - prismatic, cylindrical and pouch-type, all of which are fundamentally the same in functionality, but each has pros and cons.
Prismatic and cylindrical batteries are cased in hard materials. Pouch-types use sealed flexible foils and are protected by thin metal bags. SK On currently produces only pouch-type batteries for EVs. 
While the firm secured prismatic battery technology, it is also looking to develop cylindrical-type batteries, widely known for the type used by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). 
When asked if SK On, which has never made a profit since it was split off from SK Innovation in late 2021, plans to cut its capital expenditure for the year, Ko said SK On is not considering that for now, adding it will not cut research and development spending. 
Earlier this year, SK On's parent SK Innovation said it had a capital spending budget of about 9 trillion won ($6.55 billion) for this year, with more than 80% allocated for SK On. 
Cross-town rival LG Energy Solution (LGES) said in April it plans to minimise capital expenditure this year due to slowing EV demand. Last month, LGES paused part of construction of its multi-billion dollar battery factory in the U.S. state of Arizona as it adjusts the pace of planned investment execution flexibly to optimize its operations.
In April, SK On said it was still on target to break even in the second half of this year. The company said this month it would implement across-the-board expense cuts, including freezing salaries of all executives until the firm turns a profit. 
SK Innovation is expected to pursue a merger with profitable gas affiliate SK E&S to help prop up SK On, local media outlets have reported.
On Friday, SK Innovation said in a regulatory filing that it would hold a board meting next Wednesday to discuss various strategic measures, including mergers to strengthen its competitiveness, but nothing has been decided.

"Southwest Air, Archer Aviation work on plans to fly air taxis in California","By David Shepardson
(Reuters) -Southwest Airlines and Archer Aviation said on Friday they have agreed to develop operational plans for electric air taxi networks built by Archer at California airports where Texas-based Southwest operates.
The companies said they have signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on a concept of operations that lays the foundation for integrated electric air taxi networks connecting California airports and surrounding communities.
Southwest shares rose 2% while Archer was up 10.5%.
Electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOL) have been touted as the future of urban air mobility. Archer is developing its Midnight eVTOL aircraft.
Airlines are looking at developing transport services using battery-powered aircraft that can take off and land vertically to ferry travelers to airports or on short trips between cities, allowing them to beat traffic.
""Southwest is eager to explore the convenience Archer’s air taxis could provide customers flying Southwest at airports in busy urban areas,” said Paul Cullen, vice president real estate at Southwest, which operates at 14 California airports.
In May, the U.S. Congress approved legislation aimed at helping speed approval and deployment of eVTOL aircraft.
Archer thinks the partnership could help shave significant time off trips in California, replacing 60-to-90-minute automobile commutes with estimated 10-to-20-minute air taxi flights through a ""safe, low-noise, cost-competitive transportation option with no direct emissions.""
Archer Chief Commercial Officer Nikhil Goel said the partnership hopes to offer door-to-door trips anywhere in California in three hours or less, like Santa Monica to Napa using air taxis on both ends.
Goel said ""really meaningful time savings"" were possible, with passengers avoiding rush-hour traffic to airports. Archer hopes customers will eventually be able to book an Archer air taxi ticket at the time they buy a Southwest plane ticket.
United Airlines is also an investor in Archer Aviation.
In 2022, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said it had invested $60 million in air taxi startup  Joby Aviation  (NYSE:JOBY) for a 2% equity stake, aiming to initially offer passengers air taxi transport to and from airports in New York and Los Angeles.
The companies plan to integrate a Joby-operated service into Delta's customer-facing channels to provide short-range airport transport.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/southwest-airlines-archer-aviation-to-develop-operational-plans-for-flying-air-taxis-in-california-3517375
