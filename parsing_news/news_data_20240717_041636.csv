Warner Bros Discovery rises after BofA says possible sale of assets likely beneficial,"(Reuters) - Shares of Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) rose more than 6% on Tuesday after Bank of America (BofA) Global Research said the company could create more value for its shareholders if it explored strategic options, including a potential sale.
The loss-making media conglomerate has been reeling from the effects of subdued advertising in the U.S. and certain international markets. The fallout of last year's Hollywood strikes have also impacted the company's studio segment. 
Warner could explore a scenario where it could spin off its direct-to-customer and studio assets as a standalone company, BofA said in a note on Tuesday. 
This could be a negative for Warner's debt, but could be accretive to equity value, it added.
BofA added that Warner could explore selling itself or its streaming services could be merged with another streaming entity and potentially co-owned.
Since the merger between Discovery and AT&T (NYSE:T) spin-off Warner Media in 2022, shares of Warner Bros Discovery have fallen nearly 70%.
Warner did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
""While several financial assumptions behind the combination of Warner Media and Discovery have not materialized, we still believe several of WBD's assets are best in class with tremendous unrecognized value,"" BofA said.
Fears of market saturation have forced media companies to bundle their streaming businesses and offer discounted rates to attract customers who are wary of signing up and paying for numerous individual services.
Recent media reports also indicate that Warner could lose broadcasting rights for National Basketball Association in the next round of negotiations with distributors.
This could add to investor concerns about the media giant's role in the new sports-streaming partnership with Disney and Fox.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/warner-bros-discovery-rises-after-bofa-says-possible-sale-of-assets-likely-beneficial-3521531
DJT stock pulls back after 31% surge following assassination attempt,"Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) stock saw a 9% decline in premarket trading Tuesday after closing up 31% a day earlier amid a broader rally in the so-called Trump trade across markets.
The Monday surge came after an assassination attempt on the Republican candidate boosted expectations of his victory in the November election. Stocks in the crypto and gun sectors, as well as other companies that might benefit from a Donald Trump presidency, also saw gains.
Trump's survival after being shot in the ear strengthened his lead in betting odds over President Joe Biden. These odds further increased later on Monday after Trump selected U.S. Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate and the Republican Party officially nominated him to run again at their national convention in Milwaukee.
Trump Media, the parent company of the social media platform Truth Social, has seen its shares surge 132% in 2024 as retail traders bet on Trump winning a second term.
However, Citi analysts suggest that while Trump currently has the upper hand in the election, the boost in odds following the assassination attempt might diminish in the coming months.
""The assassination attempt on former President Trump will likely lead to a short-term boost in the polls, that may well at least partially fade by November,"" they wrote.
""Some historical episodes suggest a minor initial boost in the polls that may then partially reverse.""
Trump made a return to the public eye at the Republican National Convention on Monday evening, where he received a warm welcome from thousands of supporters just two days after the attempt on his life.
Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk intends to commit around $45 million per month to a new super political-action committee (PAC) supporting Trump’s presidential campaign.
The group, named America PAC, includes notable backers such as Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) co-founder Joe Lonsdale, the Winklevoss twins, former U.S. ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft, and her husband, Joe Craft, the CEO of  Alliance Resource  (NASDAQ:ARLP) Partners.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/djt-stock-pulls-back-after-31-surge-following-assassination-attempt-3520410

Dollar climbs after solid retail sales data,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar strengthened on Tuesday, after a reading of retail sales proved to be firmer than expected, but was not strong enough to alter expectations for the path of interest rates from the Federal Reserve. 
U.S. retail sales were unchanged in June, topping expectations of economists polled by Reuters for a decline of 0.3%, as a drop in receipts at auto dealerships was offset by strength elsewhere, a show of consumer resilience that boosts economic growth prospects for the second quarter.
""It isn't so much the overall number, but it's the ex-autos number, which was up considerably more than expected,"" said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FX Street in New York.
""The auto sales are being depressed by interest rates so aside from that and of course the housing market, it looks like the consumer's still doing pretty well and we all know that's the base of the U.S. economy."" 
Other data showed import prices were unchanged in June, as a rebound in the price of food was offset by lower energy prices, giving the Fed cushion to cut interest rates this year. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, gained 0.17% to 104.42. The Japanese yen weakened 0.41% against the greenback to 158.64 per dollar. 
Markets are still fully pricing in a rate cut of at least 25 basis points (bps) by the Fed at its September meeting, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. 
Sterling weakened 0.12% to $1.2951 ahead of British inflation data due on Wednesday while the euro was down 0.14% at $1.0879 ahead of a European Central Bank (ECB) policy meeting scheduled for Thursday. 
The ECB is largely expected to keep rates steady, putting the focus on comments from President Christine Lagarde for clues on the timing of the next rate cut following a 25 bps reduction in June. 
On Monday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the second quarter's three U.S. inflation readings ""add somewhat to confidence"" that the pace of price increases is returning to the Fed's target in a sustainable way. 
The Canadian dollar weakened 0.08% versus the greenback to 1.37 per dollar after the country's slower-than-expected rise in consumer prices in June bolstered expectations that yet another rate cut by the Bank of Canada is in the offing next week.
Cryptocurrencies paused following a rally in the prior session, along with shares of companies that could benefit from a Trump presidency, after an assassination bid on the Republican candidate boosted expectations that he would win the November election.

Fed's Kugler says recent data indicates inflation headed to 2% target,"By Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Recent data suggests inflation will continue to decline to the U.S. central bank's 2% target, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler said on Tuesday, citing the faster drop in price pressures in recent months, moderation in wages, and an emerging balance between businesses' demand for workers and the number of people looking for jobs.
The job market in particular ""has seen substantial rebalancing,"" with wage growth moderating and measures of demand for workers coming into line with pre-pandemic levels, Kugler said in remarks prepared for delivery to a National Association for Business Economics seminar.
""This continued rebalancing suggests that inflation will continue to move down toward our 2 percent target,"" Kugler said. ""If economic conditions continue to evolve in this favorable manner with more rapid disinflation, as evidenced in the inflation data of the past three months, and employment softening but remaining resilient as seen in the past few jobs reports, I anticipate that it will be appropriate to begin easing monetary policy later this year.""
Kugler did not specify when rates might fall, but her remarks are consistent with a developing sense that the Fed will lay the groundwork for rate cuts at its July 30-31 policy meeting, and likely start reducing borrowing costs at its Sept. 17-18 gathering. Investors currently put more than a 90% probability on that outcome.
""Despite a few bumps at the beginning of the year, inflation has continued to trend down in all price categories,"" Kugler said, with the consumer price index actually falling from May to June.
""Supply and demand are gradually coming into better balance. Supply-side bottlenecks continue to heal, and demand has moderated,"" she said.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has also said that recent data has boosted confidence that inflation will decline to the 2% target from its current level about half a percentage point above that mark.
The bulk of Kugler's remarks dealt with the challenges of economic measurement, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when official government data often lagged developments in the economy and was out of sync with the pace at which Fed policymakers and other officials were making decisions.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/feds-kugler-says-recent-data-indicates-inflation-headed-to-2-target-3521520
"Dow, small caps surge on rate cut hopes, solid data","By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks were mixed on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average building on Monday's all-time closing high after solid retail sales data bolstered expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve is close to easing interest rates.
The S&P 500 also rose, but megacap growth stocks, led by  Nvidia Corp  (NASDAQ:NVDA) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), pulled the tech-heavy Nasdaq lower.
Economically sensitive small caps extended their rally. The Russell 2000 scored a fifth straight day of gains greater than 1%, its longest winning streak since April 2000. The index was last up 2.9%, touching its highest level since January 2022.
Dow transportation stocks also outperformed the broader indexes as investors increasingly focused on undervalued areas of the market.
Value stocks, which have underperformed their growth peers and the broader S&P 500 so far this year, jumped 1.3%.
""This rotation underscores the likelihood of interest rate cuts as early as September,"" said Greg Bassuk, CEO at AXS Investments in New York. ""Small cap companies are among the best-positioned to benefit from rate cuts, and today we're seeing this trifecta of strong earnings, a resilient economy and high confidence of a rate cut in September."" 
Economic data on Tuesday included stronger-than-expected retail sales reported by the Commerce Department. This provided reassurance that consumers, responsible for about 70% of U.S. gross domestic product, have stayed resilient despite restrictive monetary policy, and eased fears that high interest rates could tip the economy into recession.
""We are in a Goldilocks environment right now, with inflation dropping, the economy continuing to perform well, and slightly better-than-expected corporate earnings,"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, in New York.

Morgan Stanley rose 1.1% even after the investment bank posted disappointing wealth management revenue.
 Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) slid 8.6% after reporting a dip in interest income.

Squishmallows maker can sue Build-A-Bear over alleged knockoffs,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge rejected Build-A-Bear Workshop's effort to dismiss a lawsuit claiming that its Skoosherz plush toys were unauthorized knockoffs of Squishmallows, the popular plush toys made by a unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa).
In a decision on Monday, U.S. District Judge Josephine Staton in Los Angeles said it would be ""particularly inapt"" to dismiss Kelly Toys' lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, in light of the apparent similarities between the products.
The judge cited online accounts associated with Build-A-Bear where users posted comments such as ""so now ur making squishmallows?"" and ""Cmon plagiarism"" when discussing Skoosherz.
""This case is not an instance where the works are so dissimilar by plain sight that any person observing them could confidently conclude that they do not share substantial similarities,"" Staton wrote.
Build-A-Bear and lawyers for the St. Louis-based company did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. Lawyers for Los Angeles-based Kelly Toys and its parent Jazwares had no immediate comment.
Created in 2016, Squishmallows exploded in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, becoming a TikTok sensation and winning fans like Lady Gaga and Kim Kardashian.
They have been part of Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate since Berkshire bought Jazwares' parent, the insurance holding company Alleghany (NYSE:Y), in October 2022.
Kelly Toys accused Build-A-Bear of intentionally undermining its goodwill and causing confusion by copying Squishmallows' look and feel, including ""simplified Asian style Kawaii faces"" and ""velvety velour-like"" fabric.
Build-A-Bear introduced Skoosherz in January, in anticipation of Valentine's Day, saying they were ""uniquely styled for optimal hugging benefits.""
It is separately suing Kelly Toys in St. Louis federal court, seeking a declaration it did nothing wrong.
Build-A-Bear claimed it based Skoosherz on its existing plush animals, and its advertising left no doubt who made them.
Both lawsuits were filed on Feb. 12.
The cases are Kelly Toys Holdings LLC et al v  Build-A-Bear Workshop Inc  (NYSE:BBW), U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 24-01169; and Build-A-Bear Workshop Inc v Kelly Toys Holdings LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, No. 24-00211.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/squishmallows-maker-can-sue-buildabear-over-alleged-knockoffs-3521501
"Dow rides stronger corporate earnings, retail sales to fresh record high","Investing.com -- The Dow jumped to fresh record highs Tuesday, underpinned by better-than-expected retail sales data and a slew of mostly upbeat quarterly earnings from corporates.
At 13:29 ET (18:29 GMT), Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 660 points, or 1.6%, and earlier hit another all-time high of 40,887.95. The S&P 500 climbed 0.4%, and NASDAQ Composite fell 0.1%. 
Upside surprise in June retail sales points to stronger consumer 
U.S. retail sales were unchanged in June on a monthly basis, according to data released earlier Tuesday, following on from an upwardly revised 0.3% gain in May.
This release was stronger than the expected fall of 0.3% expected, after a previously reported 0.1% gain in May, pointing to still strong consumer spending that could likely limited how many rate cuts the Fed delivers. 
""Even if the Fed did opt to open the door to rate cuts as early as Q3, the Fed will likely be limited in action, disappointing investors’ hopes of returning to neutral or below sometime soon,"" Stifel said in a Tuesday note.
Traders were now looking at a 89% chance the central bank will cut rates by 25 basis points in September, with a small chance of a 50-basis-point cut, according to CME Fedwatch.
Quarterly earnings continue as BofA, Unitedhealth impress
Wall Street banks continued to dominate earnings, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) surging 5% after the lender reported second-quarter revenue and profit topping expectations on rising investment banking and asset management fees.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) cut early losses, rising more than 1% following better-than-expected results, but Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) fell 9% as brokerage firm said on an earnings call it may pause buybacks to pay down debt and reported net interest margin that fell short of estimates.  
Unitedhealth Group (NYSE:UNH), a major dow component, jumped 6% after the health insurance giant reported Q2 results that beat on both the top and bottom line, despite headwinds in its Medicaid business.
Match group attracts activist interest;  Reddit  slips on Loop downgrade

Trump names running mate as shooting boosts presidential odds 
Wall Street has largely shrugged off any political uncertainty stemming from an assassination attempt on Trump at a Pennsylvania rally over the weekend.. 
Trump on Monday was officially nominated as the Republican frontrunner for the 2024 presidential race, and named Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his vice presidential running mate.
Trump’s chances of a victory were seen increasing sharply after the shooting over the weekend, with a Trump presidency presenting the prospect of a looser regulatory environment in the country.
