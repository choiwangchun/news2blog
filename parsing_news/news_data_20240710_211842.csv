"Microsoft, Tesla and Goodyear rise premarket; 3M and Honeywell fall","Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures largely edged higher Wednesday, ahead of the second round of comments from Fed chief Jerome Powell to Congress.
Here are some of the biggest premarket U.S. stock movers today:
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock rose 0.4% following a report that the software giant was ready to give up an observation seat on the board of OpenAI amid regulatory scrutiny into generative artificial intelligence in both the U.S. and  Europe.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/microsoft-tesla-and-goodyear-rise-premarket-3m-and-honeywell-fall-3513541
"Powell returns, Microsoft's board seat, Chinese inflation - what's moving markets","Investing.com -- Fed chief Jerome Powell makes the climb up Capitol Hill again Wednesday, and trading is largely rangebound on Wall Street ahead of this. Microsoft has decided to give up its seat on the board of Open AI, while weak Chinese inflation data indicates a slowing recovery in this important economy. 
1. Powell returns to Capitol Hill
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell returns to Capitol Hill later Wednesday, for the second day of his semi-annual Congressional testimony, this time before the House of Representatives.
Powell flagged the recent labor market cooling, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, as an increasingly important factor in deciding when the U.S. central bank will start cutting interest rates.  
“Elevated inflation is not the only risk we face,” Powell said Tuesday, noting that the ""labor market has cooled really significantly across so many measures.""
""Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment,” Powell said, after noting that labor market indicators ""have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic.”
Market participants have taken these comments as the Fed chief preparing the ground for a September cut, acknowledging that inflation isn’t the only factor in deciding monetary policy, but will look for more refinement in his comments later in the session.
2. Futures little changed; Powell speaks again
U.S. stock futures are little changed Wednesday, as investors await the second round of testimony from Fed chief Jerome Powell on Capitol Hill. 
By 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 20 points, or 0.1%, lower, while S&P 500 futures climbed 4 points, or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 35 points, or 0.2%.
The broad-based S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed at fresh record highs on Tuesday, after Fed head Jerome Powell hinted the central bank could soon start easing monetary policy, while the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average underperformed. 
Powell continues his testimony later Wednesday, this time before the House Financial Services Committee. 
There’s little in the way of significant U.S. economic data scheduled Wednesday, and all eyes will be on Thursday’s June consumer price index reading, which many see as a key test for the market and the outlook for rate cuts.
3. Microsoft ditches OpenAI board seat
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has given up its observer seat at the board of OpenAI, amid regulatory scrutiny into generative artificial intelligence in both the U.S. and  Europe.
The software giant stated that such a position was no longer necessary given an improvement in AI start-up's governance in the past eight months.
""Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction. Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,"" it said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9.
An OpenAI spokesperson said the company will establish a new engagement approach by hosting regular stakeholder meetings with strategic partners such as Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Microsoft took a non-voting, observer position on OpenAI's board in November last year after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took back the reins of the company.
The observer seat and Microsoft's more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in Europe, Britain and the U.S. over how much control it exerts over OpenAI.
4. Chinese consumer deflation 
Chinese consumer inflation shrank in June on a monthly basis, while producer inflation contracted for a 20th consecutive month, pointing to a very slow recovery for the world's second-largest economy.
Month-on-month CPI inflation shrank 0.2% in June, compared to expectations for a contraction of 0.1%, while on an annual basis inflation grew 0.2% year-on-year in June, below expectations for a print of 0.4%.
The weak CPI reading comes as consumers reined in discretionary spending, spooked by relatively high unemployment as well as concerns over a property market downturn.
The lackluster consumer spending presents more near-term headwinds for the country, and suggests the likelihood of more stimulus measures by the Chinese government.
Producer price index inflation shrank 0.8% in June, an improvement from the 1.4% contraction seen in the prior month, and shrinking at its slowest pace since February 2023. 
5. Crude falls on weak Chinese inflation data
Crude prices fell Wednesday, adding to the previous session’s losses as weak Chinese inflation data raised concerns about the health of the second largest economy in the world.
By 04:00 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) dropped 0.4% to $81.12 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $84.33 a barrel.
Concerns over deflation in China, the world’s largest importer of crude,  weighed on the oil market Wednesday, although a bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. inventories has limited the losses. 
Data from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, showed that U.S. oil inventories fell 1.9 million barrels last week, as the summer driving season continued.
Both benchmarks lost about 3% in the previous three sessions on signs that the Texas energy industry came off relatively unscathed from Hurricane Beryl.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/powell-returns-microsofts-board-seat-chinese-inflation--whats-moving-markets-3513027
Trump will win by 'a landslide' says Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet,"Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado has become the first Senate Democrat to publicly express doubts about President Joe Biden's ability to win the upcoming election.
During an appearance on CNN, Bennet confirmed he had shared these concerns with colleagues Sens. Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, though he stopped short of calling for Biden to withdraw from the race.
“Well, it’s true that I said that, and I did say that behind closed doors. And you guys and others asked whether I had said it, and that is what I said. So I figured I should come here and say it publicly,” the senior US senator said.
Bennet, who previously ran against Biden in the 2020 primary, raised concerns over recent polling showing former President Donald Trump leading Biden less than four months before Election Day.
“Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House,” he cautioned.
“So for me, this isn’t a question about polling, it’s not a question of politics. It’s a moral question about the future of our country, and I think it’s critically important for us to come to grips with what we face if, together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.”
President Biden has recently remained resolute, declaring in conference calls and a public letter to Democratic lawmakers that he is the party’s nominee and will not step down. However, Bennet’s remarks are seen as a blow to Biden’s campaign, which has been working hard to prevent Democratic defections and solidify support on Capitol Hill after Biden's poor debate performance on June 27.
Bennet’s statements might also encourage other skeptical or vulnerable Democrats to voice similar concerns.
Congressional Democrats met behind closed doors on Tuesday to discuss the next steps, and most of them were tight-lipped as they exited the meeting, describing the discussion as “constructive.”
However, according to CNN, Bennet, Tester, and Brown, had all expressed concerns about Biden's chances of winning the election. The report also suggested that these concerns were raised individually rather than collectively.
Both Brown and Tester are facing tough re-election campaigns this fall.
“I have very legitimate questions about this,” Brown commented but refrained from discussing private meetings.
Meanwhile, Tester did not deny the reports about his remarks and chose not to comment further.
Later, he issued a statement saying, “President Biden’s bad debate performance raised serious questions about whether he’s up [to] the job for the next four years. As I have said, he needs to prove to the American people, and me, that he can do it.”",https://www.investing.com/news/politics/trump-will-win-by-a-landslide-says-democratic-sen-michael-bennet-3513061
"Goldman raises its Tesla stock target, previews Q2 earnings","Goldman Sachs analysts have raised their estimates and price target for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) following stronger-than-expected Q2 deliveries while maintaining a Neutral rating on the stock.
The Wall Street giant has lifted its price target from $175 to $248, which is roughly 5% lower than Tesla’s last closing price.
Earlier this month, Tesla reported preliminary Q2 vehicle deliveries of approximately 444,000, a 15% increase quarter-over-quarter but a 5% decrease year-over-year. Production was around 411,000 vehicles, a 14% year-over-year decline. In comparison, Q1 deliveries were about 387,000, with production at roughly 433,000.
The Q2 deliveries exceeded the Visible Alpha Consensus of approximately 439,000 by 1%, and surpassed Goldman Sachs' estimate of 415,000 by 7%. The numbers also surpassed the investor-anticipated range of 410,000 to 430,000 based on intra-quarter data points, Goldman noted.
""We attribute the better volumes to a combination of factors including inventory reduction, incentives from Tesla, and the Model 3 Long Range variant recently regaining IRA credit eligibility in the US,"" analysts said in a note.
Looking ahead, Goldman Sachs highlights several key points regarding Tesla's outlook.
They foresee key debates shifting towards vehicle pricing and Tesla’s automotive non-GAAP gross margin, with inventory reduction seen as a positive indicator for future pricing. However, lower production and the cost of 0%/low financing incentives could turn into margin headwinds, alongside potential tariff impacts.
They project Tesla's non-GAAP automotive gross margin to decline to 15.3% in Q2 2024 from 16.4% in Q1 2024 and 18.1% in Q2 2023 due to these factors.
“We believe this will be driven by lower production (both qoq and yoy), and the incentive/pricing actions Tesla has used,” analysts said.
They also pointed out the outlook and timing for new, lower-cost models and variants, which Tesla plans to start shipping as early as late 2024 or 2025. They believe these new models will likely incorporate design elements from existing models but with potential modifications.
The bank now sees Tesla’s volume estimates of 1.811 million vehicles for 2024, aligning with the Visible Alpha consensus of 1.80 million, and maintains their 2025 forecast at 2.1 million. Moreover, lower-cost models are expected to positively impact Tesla’s market share, which currently stands at approximately 50% in the US EV market, 10-20% in select European countries, and high-single digits in China.
Lastly, Goldman’s team emphasized Tesla’s progress with Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and the upcoming August 8 robotaxi event.
Analysts view Tesla as a leader in AI and software technology within the automotive sector, with software and services potentially contributing significantly to Tesla’s earnings by 2030. However, they note that achieving a Level 3 version of FSD will take more time.
For robotaxis, Goldman Sachs sees an early-stage revenue opportunity based on current ride-sharing market prices and projected deployment of robotaxi vehicles.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/goldman-raises-its-tesla-stock-target-previews-q2-earnings-3513475

His second day of monetary policy testimony before the House Financial Services Committee is scheduled for 1400 GMT.
Markets are also awaiting June inflation data out of the U.S. and Germany due on Thursday.
On quarterly earnings forecast, Deutsche Bank analysts in a note said, ""we expect both earnings and sales to have increased slightly in Q2, marking the first positive y-o-y growth rate since Q1 2023.""

"Megacaps boost futures as Wall Street stays upbeat ahead of data, earnings","By Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Ankika Biswas
(Reuters) -S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures rose in a record-breaking Wall Street rally on Wednesday, on continued strength in heavily weighted stocks, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks and crucial inflation prints set to offer more direction this week.
AI-chip favorite Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) climbed 1.1% in premarket trading, after hitting a near three-week high in the previous session. 
Other chip stocks including  Arm  Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) gained around 1% each, with U.S.-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest contract chipmaker, climbing 2% after its second-quarter revenue handily beat estimates.
All the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks were trading higher, with U.S. Treasury yields falling. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were up around 0.4% each. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), too, edged up 0.5% after HSBC hiked its price target on the EV maker's stock, which clocked its longest winning streak of 10 sessions this year on Tuesday.
The group of seven stocks has been the main force behind Wall Street's banner rally this year, while the broader market has lagged, leading some market watchers to question the sustainability of equity gains and call for greater diversification.
The benchmark S&P 500 closed at an all-time high for the fifth straight session on Tuesday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq notched its sixth record closing high, after hopes for an interest-rate cut in September received a boost from Jerome Powell, who said the U.S. was ""no longer an overheated economy"". 
However, as expected, Powell refrained from committing to a timeline for rate cuts in his testimony to Congress. He is slated to appear before the House Financial Services Committee at 10 a.m. ET for further questioning from lawmakers. 
""We believe Powell is happy with keeping markets relatively quiet at this stage as some data starts to go in the right direction, we did read a still modestly dovish bias in Powell’s testimony, as he kept adding emphasis on the risks of unduly weakening activity and employment,"" analysts at ING said in a note. 
Bets on a 25-basis-point rate cut by September have hovered around 70% for the past week, up from 45% a month ago, according to CME's FedWatch. Comments from Fed officials Austan Goolsbee, Michelle Bowman and Lisa Cook are also expected through the day.
Attention will now shift to U.S. inflation data this week, with the Consumer Price Index due on Thursday and the Producer Price Index report on Friday. 
The second-quarter earnings season, which kicks off this week with major banks due to report on Friday, will be a key test for whether high-flying megacaps can justify expensive valuations and continue their strong runs. 
At 7:26 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 4 points, or 0.01%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 8 points, or 0.14%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 55.25 points, or 0.27%.

"XAU/USD: Citi expects physical gold demand to rebound, maintains $3,000 target","Physical gold demand likely softened in the second quarter compared to the first, although “off a very strong base,” Citi analysts said in a Tuesday note.
The Wall Street behemoth notes that underlying gold consumption growth is still trending positively for 2024, potentially driving spot trading towards a record average price range of $2,400-$2,600 per ounce in the second half of the year “as financial investors play catch-up.”
Non-monetary gold imports into China decreased to a robust 137 tons per month in the second quarter from an unprecedented 189 tons per month in the first quarter. Citi continues to project a record 1,750 tons of onshore bullion imports in 2024, marking an 18% year-on-year increase and an eightfold rise from the 2020 pandemic levels.
""If our assessment is accurate, Chinese retail gold imports would represent 47% of world gold mine output in 2024, versus a 2021-2023 average of 34% and a 2017-2019 average of 36%,"" the analysts state.
Meanwhile, official sector gold demand has stabilized at a record 28-30% of gold mine production since 2022, with the potential to increase towards 35% in a bull case scenario over the next year due to trade wars and concerns about US fiscal policies, Citi said.
Analysts model a record ~1,100 tons of central bank gold buying in 2024, a 5.8% year-on-year increase, with the possibility of exceeding 1,250 tons in a bullish scenario.
Moreover, inflows into gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) should also improve in the second half of the year as the Federal Reserve begins its rate-cutting cycle, Citi added.
""We remain constructive on gold physical uptake over the next 12 months with a potential Fed cutting cycle and US labor market headwinds buttressing paper demand for the yellow metal,"" the bank's analysts wrote.
Their base case price targets for gold are $2,800-$3,000 per ounce by mid-2025, representing a 10-20% increase versus the forwards.",https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/xauusd-citi-expects-physical-gold-demand-to-rebound-maintains-3000-target-3513535
3M CFO Patolawala to leave company at end of July,"(Reuters) -3M said on Wednesday its CFO Monish Patolawala would leave the company at the end of the month to pursue another opportunity, the second major change at the post-it maker's top brass this year.
Patolawala, who is also 3M's President, will stay on until July 31 to ensure an orderly transition, the manufacturing giant said, adding it has initiated a search process for his replacement.
3M shares were down 2.2% before the bell. The stock has fallen about 23% since Patolawala assumed office on July 1, 2020, as the company struggled with a slump in demand for electronics while dealing with costly legal settlements tied to military earplugs and ""forever chemicals"".
The company, to mitigate the impact of a slowdown in demand, has rolled out a major restructuring that includes cutting thousands of jobs and the spin off of its healthcare business into a listed company.
In March, 3M appointed former L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) head Bill Brown as its new CEO as the company continued to go through a period of slowing sales.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/3m-cfo-patolawala-to-leave-company-by-end-of-july-3513341
"Barclays launches Volvo AB at Equal Weight, favors Daimler Truck and Traton","Investing.com - Barclays has initiated coverage of Volvo AB (OTC:VLVLY) with an Equal Weight rating and a price target of SEK 300. The British investment bank acknowledged Volvo's reputation for quality and resilience in the European commercial vehicle sector in a note released on Wednesday but expressed concerns about the company's short-term growth prospects compared to its German competitors.
Barclays comments: ""Volvo's lack of commitment in North America, its heavy reliance on a challenging EU30 market, and its limited self-help capabilities are not in its favor. Additionally, we believe the company has a relative disadvantage in terms of TSR (Total Shareholder Return) and valuation.""
The Volvo Group is considered a benchmark in the EU commercial vehicle industry but faces challenges in the current macroeconomic environment, limiting the potential for significant stock outperformance. Barclays believes that ""this is not enough in the current truck/macro environment to elevate the stock to the next level, especially compared to its German competitors.""
Barclays highlights several factors influencing their preference for Daimler Truck (OTC:MBGAF) (with a price target of EUR 55) and  Traton SE  (ETR:8TRA) (with a price target of EUR 38) over Volvo. Key factors include ""better valuation, low investor expectations confirmed by the recent stock price decline,"" and a persistent valuation gap between Volvo and its German rivals, with Daimler Truck trading at about a 25% discount and Traton at around 50% compared to Volvo.
A screening matrix developed by Barclays evaluates Daimler Truck and the Traton Group more favorably in several areas. Daimler Truck scores well in North America exposure, smart capital allocation, and Total Shareholder Return (TSR), while the Traton Group is highlighted for its self-help potential and corporate governance. In contrast, Volvo's high exposure to Europe and limited short-term self-help potential present a relative disadvantage.
Barclays also emphasizes the ongoing normalization of demand in key markets for both commercial vehicles and construction equipment, with Europe being more affected than North America. This aligns with Volvo's forecasts for 2024, predicting that the heavy-duty truck market in the EU30 will decrease by about 18% year-over-year to 280,000 units and the North American Class 8 truck market will decline by 12% to 290,000 units.
Despite these challenges, Barclays acknowledges Volvo's efforts to expand its presence in North America, including developing a new production facility in Mexico, expected to be operational by 2026. This initiative aims to increase Volvo's market share in the southwestern and western U.S. and Mexico, where the company is currently underrepresented, according to experts.
Although Barclays appreciates Volvo's strong earnings and cash resilience, stemming from a decentralized business model and lean cost structure, the bank remains skeptical about short-term catalysts for the stock. Therefore, Barclays prefers Daimler Trucks and the Traton Group over Volvo AB.
