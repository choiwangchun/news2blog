"S&P 500, Nasdaq open modestly higher despite hotter than expected June PPI","Investing.com-- Major US indices showed little movement in early Friday trade despite key earnings reports from major banks such as JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo. These reports are set to propel the second-quarter earnings season forward.
At 09:35 AM EST (13:35 GMT), the S&P 500 was up 0.15% while Nasdaq rose 0.08%. Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) gained 0.2%.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the largest bank in the United States, saw its stock decline modestly after Q2 net interest income (NII) matched analyst expectations.
On the other hand, Wells Fargo's Q2 NII missed market expectations by around $200 million, causing shares to drop about 6%. Citi stock gained 1.5% after the bank reported earnings.
Investors are looking forward to robust profit growth from a diverse range of companies, which could potentially extend the rally in U.S. stocks beyond the dominant tech sector.
""If analysts’ predictions are accurate, this quarter’s year-over-year EPS growth rate will be the highest since the fourth quarter of 2021,"" Bernstein analysts wrote in a note.
Tech-heavy Nasdaq suffered a setback of nearly 2% on Thursday. This decline was influenced by a shift in investor interest from large-cap stocks to smaller companies amid increasing expectations that the Federal Reserve will slash rates in September. 
Market participants are now pricing in an 86% chance of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September, an increase from the 72% probability observed a week prior.
US producer price index is now up 2.6% year over year
The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics released the producer price index (PPI) report for June, which surpassed Wall Street forecasts.
The PPI, which measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output, saw a 0.2% increase last month, contrary to the 0.1% rise anticipated by economists.
This latest figure places the PPI 2.6% higher than the same period last year. Notably, the increase in prices for services in June helped to counterbalance a decline in the prices for goods.
Moreover, the May PPI reading was revised upwards, showing no change compared to the initially reported 0.2% decrease.
The higher-than-expected PPI data contrasts with recent trends suggesting a decline in inflation. It follows the release of the June consumer price index (CPI), which was reported on Thursday and came in lower than expected.
The CPI, a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services, indicated that headline inflation had decreased on a monthly basis, with a year-over-year rate of 3%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) extends losses after UBS downgrade
Tesla stock fell a further 3.3% Friday after UBS downgraded the stock's rating from Neutral to Sell.
The brokerage firm acknowledged the positive developments in Tesla's diverse business areas but expressed concerns over the heightened expectations for its core Automotive division.
The analysts pointed out that Tesla has historically enjoyed a premium valuation due to anticipated growth in various initiatives, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI). Despite Tesla's current market capitalization reflecting over $500 billion in value for future growth, the analysts argued that justifying a Buy rating would require an even greater growth opportunity.
While recognizing the progress in AI, UBS cautioned that the investment is expensive, the pace of improvement could decelerate, and the return on investment is likely to be realized in the distant future. They suggested that a waning market enthusiasm for AI could adversely affect Tesla's stock multiple.
The recent reversal in Tesla's stock price ends an 11-day rally, which was initially sparked by a robust second-quarter deliveries report that temporarily eliminated the stock's year-to-date losses.
With the latest decline, Tesla's shares have once again dipped into negative territory for the year 2024.
Asian tech slammed by profit-taking, Nikkei slides 2%
Tech-heavy indexes in Asia, which had mostly outpaced their regional peers in recent weeks, clocked the heaviest losses on Friday. The sector saw a heavy degree of profit-taking after hype over AI sparked a major melt-up in valuations this year.
Traders were seen pivoting into other economically-sensitive sectors, which are now set to benefit from lower interest rates.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was emblematic of this trend, slumping 2.2% from record highs hit on Thursday. The broader TOPIX, which is a lot less tech-heavy than the Nikkei, fell 0.9%. Chipmakers  Renesas Electronics Corp  (TYO:6723),  Advantest Corp.  (TYO:6857) and  Tokyo Electron Ltd.  (TYO:8035) slid between 4% to 7%, while tech investment house SoftBank Group Corp. (TYO:9984) lost 3.2%. 
South Korea’s KOSPI slid 1.4% with memory chip making major  SK Hynix Inc  (KS:000660) losing over 3%.
TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM), the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, and a key driver of the recent tech rally, slid over 4% from record highs. 
Hong Kong outperforms on bargain buying, ASX hits record high 
But major Chinese technology stocks largely ducked weakness in their global peers, as relatively lower valuations in the sector drove in a slew of bargain hunting.
Hong Kong-listed Chinese tech majors such as  Baidu  (NASDAQ:BIDU) Inc (HK:9888), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) rose over 2% each, which helped the Hang Seng index rally 2%. The index also pulled further away from a two-month low hit earlier this week.
Chinese markets fell less than their broader peers, with the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes treading water on Friday.
Australia’s ASX 200 outperformed its Asian peers, rising 0.9% to a record high of 7,969.10 points. The index, which has a relatively small weightage of technology stocks, was boosted by flows into economically sensitive sectors such as mining and industrials.
These sectors advanced across the board in Asia, given that they are expected to benefit from a low interest rate environment. 
Futures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a flat open, with gains in industrials and consumer stocks set to offset losses in tech. The Nifty and the BSE Sensex 30 had both scaled record peaks earlier this week amid persistent optimism over the Indian economy.

Biden 'may have just committed an unforced tactical error'. UBS explains how,"President Biden began his much-awaited press conference on Thursday evening by reviewing the NATO Summit in Washington and highlighting his administration’s accomplishments.
His opening remarks served as a robust defense of multilateral engagement as the cornerstone of American foreign policy and were also aimed at creating a more favorable context for addressing media questions regarding his physical and mental fitness.
According to UBS strategists, Biden’s performance during the conference was ""decidedly mixed,"" with energetic comments on gun control being undermined by missteps concerning the capability of his own vice president to assume the presidency and win a national election.
""In short, the presser is unlikely to change many minds over whether he should continue to pursue the nomination at next month's convention,"" UBS strategists remarked.
""At least one response may come back to haunt the president,” strategists added.
Near the end of the press conference, when asked whether convention delegates should be obligated to vote for him, Biden stated that the delegates “are free to do whatever they want.” Currently, rules direct delegates to reflect the “sentiments of those who elected them.”
This response might inadvertently give the party’s rules committee a chance to change the instructions given to delegates, potentially allowing them to vote their conscience in the first round of balloting.
""While the probability of a rule change is still low, the president may have just committed an unforced tactical error,"" strategists concluded.
In his first response during the conference, Biden mistakenly referred to Vice-President Kamala Harris as ""Vice-President Trump,"" further fueling widespread concerns about his verbal missteps. This error occurred merely an hour after he incorrectly introduced Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky as “President Putin” during the NATO summit.",https://www.investing.com/news/politics/biden-may-have-just-committed-an-unforced-tactical-error-ubs-explains-how-3517539
"JPMorgan posts strong Q2 earnings, tops expectations","JPMorgan (JPM) reported a robust second quarter, with earnings surpassing analyst expectations, but its stock declined, falling over 2% at the open.
The financial giant announced an EPS of $4.40, which was $0.26 higher than the consensus estimate of $4.14.
The firm's net income stood at $18.1 billion, marking a significant 25% increase, bolstered by a $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa (NYSE:V) shares and a $1.0 billion donation of Visa shares to pre-fund contributions to the Firm’s Foundation. Net revenue also experienced a notable rise, up 20% to reach $51.0 billion. Excluding the Visa-related gain, noninterest revenue was up 14%, driven by higher investment banking fees, asset management fees, and CIB Markets noninterest revenue.
Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon commented on the quarter's performance, highlighting the company's net income of $13.1 billion and a return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 20%, after accounting for the Visa shares gain and other discretionary items. Dimon also pointed out the significant growth in the company's CIB segment, with investment banking fees increasing by 50% and market share improving to 9.5% year-to-date (YTD). Moreover, the Card Services net charge-off rate was reported at 3.50%.
The provision for credit losses was $3.1 billion, which included net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million. The net charge-offs were up $820 million, primarily due to Card Services. The net reserve build consisted of $609 million in Consumer, mainly in Card Services, and $189 million in Wholesale.
Dimon also emphasized the company's vigilance regarding potential economic risks, including geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures. He noted the firm's strong capital position, with a CET1 ratio of 15.3%, and mentioned the Board's intention to increase the common dividend for the second time this year, reflecting a 19% cumulative increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.
JPMorgan's performance in the second quarter demonstrates its ability to navigate a complex economic environment while continuing to invest in long-term growth and maintaining a robust balance sheet. The company's prudent management and strategic investments have positioned it well for future challenges and opportunities.
Reacting to the report, analysts at RBC Capital said in a note: ""Overall, relative to the uncertainty going into the quarter JPM reported strong core second quarter results, driven by better-than-expected fee revenues, partially offset by a higher provision and higher expenses.”
Analysts at Evercore ISI told investors that it is ""hard to call a 20% ROTCE & a bigger than expected buyback anything but a good quarter, but our gut is with growth driven by strong results in capital markets, asset & wealth management and Cards, but flattish trends in loans & deposits and no change to guidancein NII (or expenses), we could see a little pressure on the stock in light of its recent good run,"" they added.
Furthermore, analysts said that while there are some issues in the quarter to go through, they see a ""ton of capital at a 15.3% CET1, lots of cash/NII optionality, a tame credit outlook and continued investment in organic growth across the company.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/jpmorgan-posts-strong-q2-earnings-tops-expectations-shares-dip-3517155
"Citi lists 'Trump trades': Short oil, US over Europe, and more","Citi analysts outlined several strategic trades dubbed ""Trump trades,"" in a note Friday, focusing on the anticipated market movements influenced by a potential Trump presidency and the upcoming Fed actions.
While these trades hinge on different factors, Citi's take is clear: ""Most Trump trades may have to wait for after the Fed.""
Citi suggests that steepeners are an exception among the Trump trades, benefiting from both a dovish Federal Reserve and election-related shifts.
Analysts emphasize the attractiveness of steepeners due to the expected rate cut in September. Additionally, positioning for the outperformance of US equities over European equities can be done earlier.
However, Citi cautions against entering this trade at the current level, noting that ""French equities did not participate in the rebound in other French assets post-election, making it a poor entry point.""
Citi's analysts have a bearish outlook on oil, foreseeing a downside by late 2025.
They believe that ""expectations of a Trump presidency should add to the fundamental case for oil downside,"" citing potential tariffs that may undermine demand and geopolitical shifts that could act as a headwind. This bearish stance is part of a broader strategy, where oil typically does not perform well heading into US elections.
On the currency front, Citi has adjusted its positions, closing its long USDSEK trade and adding a long AUDCAD trade. The latter is expected to benefit from ""deteriorating US growth, with the rest of the world holding on,"" which is USD bearish.
The trade is further supported by favorable terms of trade and central bank actions, alongside a typically positive influence from the upcoming Chinese third plenum.
Overall, Citi's analysts are preparing for significant market movements influenced by both the Federal Reserve's actions and potential political developments, with specific strategies tailored to navigate these anticipated changes.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/citi-lists-trump-trades-short-oil-us-over-europe-and-more-3517032
Natural disasters cost China $13 billion in January-June,"By Liz Lee
BEIJING (Reuters) -Natural disasters such as flooding, drought and extreme temperatures cost China 93.16 billion yuan ($12.83 billion) in the first half of this year, with almost 33 million people affected, the government said on Friday.
Heavy snow, 22 strong earthquakes including one of 7.1 magnitude in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, landslides and mudslides in southwestern regions and flooding on the Yellow (OTC:YELLQ) River and in southern provinces all added to the burden.
The 32.38 million people affected included 322 who died or disappeared, the ministry told a news briefing. About 856,000 people faced emergency resettlement, 23,000 houses were destroyed, and around 3.17 million hectares of crops damaged.
The number of people impacted compares with just 48.76 million people for the whole of 2023, when 95 people died or went missing, according to the ministry's report from last year.
The impact on the economy in January-June this year was also worse than the year-earlier period, when the country logged 38.23 billion yuan worth of loss. It was the biggest first-half disaster-related loss since 2019, according to data available on the Emergency Management Ministry website.
China has seen larger swings in temperature breaking historical records in recent years while precipitation - rain or snow - has grown more erratic, signs that point to the impact of climate change on the country's weather.
Funds channelled into disaster management have reached 4.17 billion yuan so far this year, according to a Reuters tally, with 546 million yuan allocated last month for agricultural production and disaster relief.
Long durations of icy weather and intense snow in the winter months severely disrupted people and their livelihoods, ministry spokesperson Shen Zhanli said.
Parts of southern China such as the Guangxi region, Guangdong and Fujian provinces were hit hard by frequent and extreme rains as the annual rainy season began earlier than usual. Dozens have died from floods or rain-induced landslides.
Around the same time, droughts developed quite quickly and covered large areas in the north and around the North China Plain, impacting local agricultural production. At the peak, some 6.2 million hectares of farmland faced moisture shortages compared with the average 2.67 million hectares in other years.
But losses were capped as many of the affected areas had better irrigation and water storage systems, the ministry said.
The drought season afflicted some 1.29 million people in 10 northern provinces, resulting in an economic loss of 1.46 billion yuan - lower than the average for the same period.
With the summer flood season approaching, all kinds of risks have increased significantly, the ministry said, emphasising the need for a greater sense of responsibility and urgency over safety, disaster prevention and mitigation as well as relief work.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/natural-disasters-in-china-caused-13-billion-economic-loss-in-januaryjune-3516670
"Wall St set for muted open after mixed bank results, PPI data","(Refiles to drop extraneous numbers from paragraph 7. The story was previously corrected to fix the comparative period in the same paragraph)
By Medha Singh and Ankika Biswas
(Reuters) - Wall Street was set for a subdued open on Friday as investors digested mixed results from big banks, while slightly hotter-than-expected producer price numbers reined in bets that the Federal Reserve would begin easing interest rates in September.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM)'s second-quarter profit increased on a boost from rising investment banking fees and an $8 billion accounting gain from a share exchange deal with Visa (NYSE:V). However, shares of the world's largest bank edged 0.2% lower in choppy premarket trading.
Wells Fargo slid 5.5% as the lender missed estimates for quarterly interest income, while Citigroup rose 2.8% after posting a surge in investment banking revenue and gains in its services division.
The results come against a backdrop of expectations that some of the largest U.S. banks would report weaker second-quarter profits due to lower interest payments and higher provisions for deteriorating loans.
As the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq scale new peaks, investors are hoping for strong profit growth from companies beyond heavyweight tech names such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), so that the U.S. stocks rally can broaden out.
""Big bank earnings, big tech earnings and consumer company earnings will be the most important to watch, as these companies are highly levered to the strength of the economy,"" said Clark Bellin, president and chief investment officer, Bellwether Wealth.
Analysts, on average, expect earnings for S&P 500 firms to grow by 10.1% during the quarter from a year ago, compared with a 2.8% decline in the same period in 2023, according to LSEG IBES data. Financial firms are likely to post a profit growth of 6.7%.
After data showed a surprise fall in U.S. consumer prices on Thursday, solidifying bets on a September rate cut, the latest report showed producer prices rose 0.2% on a monthly basis in June, compared to an expectation of a 0.1% rise. Annually, it rose 2.6%, versus an estimated 2.3% rise.
""Friday's stronger-than-expected PPI is an important reminder that inflation is still here and that the inflation data can be volatile,"" Bellin said.
Traders still see a 93% chance of a rate cut in September, up from 72% a week ago, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool.
Focus now turns to the University of Michigan's consumer survey report, due after markets open.
At 8:47 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 22 points, or 0.05%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 1.25 points, or 0.02%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 1.5 points, or 0.01%. 
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq logged their worst sessions in more than two months on Thursday, on a rotation out of high-flying large-cap stocks in favor of small-cap shares, which have underperformed this year. The rotation has also set the blue-chip Dow on track for its best week in four. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) dropped 1.7% after UBS downgraded the EV maker's stock to ""sell"" from ""neutral"".
BNY climbed 2.5% after the U.S. bank posted a 10% rise in second-quarter net profit.
AT&T (NYSE:T) dropped 1.5% after the telecom firm said data from about 109 million customer accounts containing records of calls and texts from 2022 had been downloaded illegally in April.

"Yen keeps markets on edge, data points to BOJ intervention","By Amanda Cooper
LONDON (Reuters) - The yen steadied on Friday, a day after the Bank of Japan likely intervened to prop up the currency, on the coat-tails of an unexpected drop in U.S. consumer prices that fuelled the largest drop in the dollar since May. 
The Japanese currency, which has been languishing around 38-year lows, strengthened rapidly on Thursday in the European afternoon, sparking speculation that authorities in Tokyo may have stepped in to buy.
This was just after the U.S. consumer inflation report for June showed prices were easing and boosted the odds of the Federal Reserve cutting rates as soon as September.
Daily operations data from the BOJ on Friday suggested the central bank had spent between 3.37-3.57 trillion yen ($21.18-22 billion) on buying the yen on Thursday, less than three months after its last foray into the market.
Tokyo's top currency diplomat, Masato Kanda, said on Friday authorities will take action as needed in the foreign exchange market, but declined to comment on if authorities had intervened.
""Currency interventions should certainty be rare in a floating rate market, but we'll need to respond appropriately to excessive volatility or disorderly moves,"" Kanda said.
A separate report from the Nikkei news outlet said the BOJ had likely conducted rate checks for the euro/yen currency pair, which analysts said was not very common. 
""There are two unusual things. Firstly, (rate-checking) the euro, which is a bit strange and secondly, normally, they (BOJ) do the rate checks before they intervene and this rate check came after the intervention,"" Pepperstone markets analyst Michael Brown said.
""But I guess it just shows that trying to second-guess what the Ministry of Finance is going to do is almost impossible,"" he said.
The MOF declined to comment on the report.
The yen was a touch weaker on Friday, leaving the dollar up 0.1% at 159.04.
The euro, which fell by as much as 3% on Thursday, was last up 0.3% against the yen at 173.165.
Tokyo intervened at the end of April and in early May, spending roughly 9.8 trillion yen ($61.55 billion) to support the currency. There will be a month-end report from Ministry of Finance that will confirm the amount spent on any intervention.
However, the yen has since gone beyond those levels, touching a 38-year low of 161.96 per dollar last week as the wide difference between U.S. and Japan rates weighed, with the currency down over 11% against the dollar so far this year. 
This gap has created a highly lucrative trading opportunity, in which traders borrow the yen at low rates to invest in dollar-priced assets for a higher return, known as carry trade.
""It looks like it will be a volatile day today with markets nervous about intervention but carry still very attractive to short the yen and the shift in the fundamental story is only marginal after last night's cooler U.S. CPI,"" said Charu Chanana, head of currency strategy at Saxo. 
CPI BOOST 
The surge in yen was triggered after data on Thursday showed U.S. consumer prices fell for the first time in four years in June, firmly putting disinflation back on track.
Traders are now pricing in 93% chance of the Fed cutting rates in September, compared with 73% before the CPI reading, CME FedWatch tool showed. Markets are pricing in 61 basis points of easing this year.
The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six others, was flat at 104.32, not far from the one-month low of 104.07 it touched on Thursday.
Elsewhere, the euro was up 0.2% at $1.0885, just below Thursday's one-month high, while sterling was nearing one-year highs. 
It was last at $1.296 after data earlier this week showed the UK economy grew more quickly than expected in May, which could reduce the chances of an August rate cut.

AT&T says data from around 109 million US customer accounts illegally downloaded,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T (NYSE:T) said Friday that data from about 109 million customer accounts containing records of calls and texts from 2022 was illegally downloaded in April.
The U.S. telecom company said the FBI is investigating and at least one person has been arrested after AT&T call logs were copied from its workspace on a third-party cloud platform. 
AT&T said the compromised data includes files containing AT&T records of calls and texts of nearly all of AT&T's cellular and AT&T's landline customers interacting with those cellular numbers between May 2022 and October 2022 but does not contain the content of calls or texts or personal information such as social security numbers.
The FBI did not immediately comment.
The compromised data also includes records from 
Jan. 2, 2023, for a very small number of customers.
AT&T said it first learned on April 19 that a hacker had claimed to have unlawfully accessed and copied AT&T call logs. The company said its investigation found hackers had between April 14 and April 25 unlawfully exfiltrated files containing AT&T records of customer call and text interactions. The records also include AT&T customers of mobile virtual network operators using AT&T's wireless network.
These records identify telephone numbers with which a wireless number interacted during these periods and aggregate call duration. A subset of records includes one or more cell site identification number.
AT&T said it has taken additional cybersecurity measures including closing off the point of unlawful access.
AT&T is working with law enforcement and said had delayed public notification after the Justice Department determined it was warranted. AT&T added it does not believe that the data is publicly available.
The company added the incident has not had a material impact on AT&T's operations.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/att-says-data-from-around-109-million-us-customer-accounts-illegally-downloaded-3517157
"Axel Springer, KKR considering split of German media giant, sources say","By Klaus Lauer
(Reuters) -German media giant Axel Springer, which owns Germany's popular Bild tabloid and U.S. news site Politico, is considering a split of the company together with private equity KKR, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.
A potential deal would separate its media assets from its digital classifieds operation, handing the former to CEO Mathias Doepfner and the founder's widow Friede Springer, and the latter to KKR and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the sources said.
The Financial Times first reported on the break-up talks.
The sources told Reuters this was the most likely plan but that many details remained open. It was unclear when a decision would be taken.
Axel Springer founded the company in 1946 and grew it into a sprawling empire encompassing influential right-leaning media titles as well as a portfolio of classifieds websites, including jobs platform Stepstone and real estate ads unit Aviv. 
Billionaire Doepfner took the helm in 2002. Most recently he has overseen Springer's ambitions to break into the field of artificial intelligence, including with a partnership with OpenAI's ChatGPT model.
The planned split would not necessarily mean that Springer would be excluded from the highly profitable classifieds business, the sources said. They declined to be identified as they are not permitted to disclose details of the talks.
Taking control of the unit could help pave the way for KKR to begin exiting its investment five years after it partnered with Doepfner to take Axel Springer private, they said.
Springer's planned listing of Stepstone, currently on pause due to the Ukraine war and difficult market conditions, is not off the table, according to the sources.
Aviv is considered another potential IPO candidate but needs more time, they said.
KKR became the biggest shareholder of Axel Springer in 2019 and currently owns a 35.6% stake, while the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board owns a 12.9% stake.
A spokesperson for Axel Springer said all shareholders have been highly satisfied with Axel Springer's progress since 2019, but declined further comment.
""Together we have made significant progress against Axel Springer's digital and international ambitions, and believe in the continued success and growth of the business,"" a KKR spokesperson told Reuters.
Springer's acquisition of Politico for $1 billion in 2021 marked the German company's shift towards the U.S. market.
Should the break-up deal free up funds for investment, this would likely flow primarily into the U.S. rather than the German media market, one of the sources said.
Responding to rumours of an interest in buying the Wall Street Journal, both sources said this was not currently an issue and the newspaper was not for sale. However, if it were to become available, Springer would look into it, they said.

"Yen briefly jumps, sparking suspicions of Japan intervention","LONDON (Reuters) -The yen jumped briefly against the dollar on Friday, putting traders on alert for signs of fresh intervention by Japanese authorities, who likely stepped in the previous day to prop up a currency still close to its lowest in 38 years.
The dollar fell as much as 1% to a one-month low of 157.30 yen, but pared some of those losses to trade down 0.35% at 158.28 yen. The euro was last down 0.1% at 172.4 yen. 
Japan's Ministry of Finance and the New York Federal Reserve were not immediately available for comment sought by Reuters. 
Daily operations data earlier in the day suggested the Bank of Japan (BOJ) may have spent over 3 trillion yen ($18.85 billion) on defending the currency on Thursday, less than three months after it last intervened. 
It was not immediately clear what was behind this latest move. Several analysts noted that it bore some of the hallmarks of official buying, but the yen's strengthening was more modest than Thursday's, raising some doubt as to whether or not the central bank was behind the trend.
""It could be a modest further round of intervention. I wouldn't be as confident as yesterday when the move was much bigger,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets.
""Given that we have the Japan holiday on Monday, it's not a bad time for them (Japanese authorities) to enforce the move. 
""It's not the greatest of shifts of the yen so far, so I wouldn't be overly confident that it's them,"" he added.
NO BREAK FOR THE YEN
Some analysts said the brief bounce in the yen could have been the result of the BOJ making checks with dealers on the exchange rate - often a precursor to buying.
The Nikkei news outlet said earlier on Friday the BOJ had made rate checks during Asia trading hours for the euro/yen currency pair. 
With the Japanese currency near its weakest since the mid-1980s, the chances of another round of BOJ buying remain high and Monday's public holiday in Japan, when market liquidity is likely to be much thinner, could provide a window, analysts said.
“They need to change tactics to keep the market on its toes and show they are serious,” said James Malcolm, head of FX strategy at UBS.
A softer reading of U.S. inflation on Thursday has helped raise the chances of a September rate cut by the Federal Reserve, which could take some pressure off the yen by making it less attractive for investors to trade the large gap between U.S. and Japanese interest rates.
""It wouldn't surprise me if it were the BOJ, going for a 1-2 punch strategy. Liquidity probably isn't great so it is a good time, and (Fed Chair) Jerome Powell's speech on Monday could help things along,"" said Kenneth Broux, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) head of corporate research FX and rates. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell will take part in an interview hosted by the Economic Club of Washington on Monday in which he may offer some kind of signal over whether a September cut might transpire.
