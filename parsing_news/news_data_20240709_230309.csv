WATCH LIVE: Fed Chair Jerome Powell Testifies on Capitol Hill,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver his semi-annual testimony on Tuesday, a highly anticipated event that could provide significant insights into the central bank's future monetary policy.
As markets await his remarks, investors and analysts are keen to decipher any signals about the direction of interest rates and the Fed's approach to managing inflation and economic growth.
Powell's testimony comes at a pivotal moment, with the Fed Chair likely to face questions on factors such as the interest rate path, inflation, and the economic growth outlook.
He is also expected to speak on the key takeaways of the Fed's Semi-Annual Federal Reserve Monetary Policy Report, published last Friday, highlighting modest further inflation progress this year.
Investors are particularly focused on Powell's stance regarding future rate cuts. Data recently showed a sharp rise in expectations for a September rate cut by the Fed, although some believe the first rate cut will arrive in December.
In a note to clients Tuesday, analysts at Macquarie said they believe Powell's tone will be dovish.
""Last week's FOMC Minutes already displayed a shift in the Fed's tone, toward caring more about the loosening labor market and softening activity indicator,"" they wrote. ""If Congress issues strong calls to have President Joe Biden abandon his candidacy, and if that raises the prospect that Donald Trump will win, it could raise US yields again.
""For good reasons, traders like to link Trump's policy agenda with inflation; they see policy rates being higher than otherwise under Trump 2.0, as we've discussed.""
As Powell takes the stand, markets will be closely monitoring his every word for clues about the Fed's future actions.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/watch-live-fed-chair-jerome-powell-testifies-on-capitol-hill-3511863
US stocks mostly higher; tech sector gains ahead of Powell's testimony,"Investing.com-- U.S. stocks mostly edged higher Tuesday as increased expectations for a September rate cut kept the tech sector buoyant before testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 
At 09:35 ET (13:35 GMT), Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 40 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 rose 10 points, or 0.2%, and NASDAQ Composite rose 75 points, or 0.4%. 
Powell testimony in focus
Powell is set to begin his two-day testimony before Congress, starting later Tuesday with the Senate before the House on Wednesday. 
The Fed Chair is expected to offer more cues on monetary policy, with markets watching for any dovish signals, especially in the wake of softer inflation and labor data in recent weeks. 
Beyond Powell’s testimony, several other Fed officials are also set to speak this week, including open markets committee members Michelle Bowman and Raphael Bostic.
Investors will also be looking to key consumer price index inflation data for June, which is due on Thursday, for more cues on the path of inflation. The Fed has repeatedly signaled that it needs more confidence that inflation is easing, before it can begin cutting interest rates.
The CME Fedwatch tool showed traders pricing in an over 70% chance for a 25 basis point cut in September, up from last week’s 59%. 
Confidence that rate cuts are coming shortly resulted in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite eking out record highs on Monday. 
Earnings season to begin with banks
Focus this week will also be on the second quarter earnings season, which is set to begin with results from several major banks at the end of the week. 
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) are set to report quarterly earnings on Friday.
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) are also on tap this week. 
Analysts, on average, see S&P 500 companies increasing their aggregate earnings per share by 10.1% in the second quarter, up from an 8.2% increase in the first quarter, according to LSEG I/B/E/S data.
Additionally, the likes of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to post gains, both rising over 2%, amid growing confidence in all things linked with artificial intelligence. 
Crude slips after Beryl passes
Crude prices edged lower Tuesday, after Hurricane Beryl caused less damage to a key U.S. oil-producing region than expected, easing concerns over supply disruption.
By 09:35 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) fell 0.2% to $82.14 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.2% to $85.56 a barrel.
Market participants are also keeping an eye on the situation in the Middle East, as hopes of a possible ceasefire deal in Gaza, potentially reducing worries about global crude supply disruption, hit crude prices on Monday.
The American Petroleum Institute releases its estimates of weekly crude inventories later in the session, with a draw expected given the summer driving season.

"A 'deeper' S&P 500 pullback is coming, Piper Sandler warns","Piper Sandler analysts are cautioning investors about a potential correction in the S&P 500, despite recent highs. Their note highlights a weakening market that could lead to a significant pullback.
In today's note warning of a potential correction, Piper Sandler stated: ""Deteriorating market breadth and narrowing leadership"" are the key concerns.
This means that fewer stocks are participating in the rally, and investors are focusing on a limited group of high-performing companies. They argue that this undermines the sustainability of the current upswing.
However, it goes against a separate note from the firm this week that said its analysts believe Wall Street will remain bullish until unemployment reaches 4.5% and they remain constructive. Even so, they flagged that most market downturns occur from either higher rates or unemployment.
Nevertheless, Piper Sandler said its technical indicators also point towards a correction. Piper Sandler's ""40-week Technique indicator"" shows a low number of stocks trending positively, suggesting weaker market internals.
While the recent jobs report might lead to a Fed rate cut, Piper Sandler says other factors are concerning.
""The MID and RTY are below their 50-day MAs and poised for a leg lower toward their respective 200-day MAs,"" the firm states, indicating a potential decline in mid-cap and small-cap stocks.
Despite maintaining its year-end target, Piper Sandler expects a ""deeper pullback/correction in the coming months."" They believe the S&P 500 is overdue for a 10% correction towards its long-term uptrend. In conclusion, Piper Sandler advises investors to be cautious. The current market dynamics suggest a correction is likely, and investors should prioritize vigilance over complacency.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/a-deeper-sp-500-pullback-is-coming-piper-sandler-warns-3511440
How to trade AI? Citi says take profits as sentiment is most elevated since 2019,"Citi analysts warned investors about potentially overheated sentiment in Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks.
Their note highlights how optimism surrounding AI stocks has reached its highest level since 2019, based on factors like market expectations and historical price movements.
""Sentiment around stocks with high exposure to AI is the most elevated it has been since 2019,"" states Citi.
This concern stems from a combination of factors. Firstly, Citi's estimates for future growth in these stocks are significantly lower than what market prices currently imply. Secondly, the recent price surge of AI stocks significantly outpaces historical growth trends. Finally, options market data suggests a potential imbalance towards bullish bets on AI.
Citi recommends capitalizing on this situation by taking profits on high-flying AI stocks, particularly those in the ""enabler"" category, such as semiconductor companies. ""We continue to suggest investors take profits in AI highfliers,"" advises Citi.
Investors can then reinvest these profits ""more broadly across the theme's value chain,"" creating a more balanced portfolio within the AI sector.
For those who are even more cautious about the AI market, Citi offers an alternative strategy: the AI Hedge Basket.
This basket is designed to benefit from a potential decline in AI stocks. ""We introduce the AI Hedge basket as an alternative to outright shorting,"" explains Citi. The basket prioritizes companies with negative correlations to high AI exposure stocks, offering a hedge against potential losses.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/how-to-trade-ai-citi-says-take-profits-as-sentiment-is-most-elevated-since-2019-3511343
Netflix target raised at TD Cowen ahead of earnings,"TD Cowen analysts are optimistic about Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) earnings, citing strong subscriber growth and a burgeoning ad tier as key drivers. 
The bank projects Netflix to add 5.19 million paid subscribers in Q2 2024, exceeding analyst consensus of 3.72 million. This growth is attributed to both paid-sharing initiatives and momentum in the ad-supported tier (AVOD).
According to a recent TD Cowen consumer survey, Netflix remains the top choice for living room viewing, highlighting its continued dominance in the home entertainment space. 
“We’ll look for color on AVOD tier, monetization & margin trends,” the analysts note, emphasizing the importance of details surrounding the ad tier's performance during the upcoming earnings report on July 18th.
Encouraged by these trends, TD Cowen raised their price target for Netflix to $775 from $725, reiterating a Buy rating. They also increased their long-term subscriber estimates, reflecting confidence in Netflix's ability to sustain growth.
While YouTube is gaining traction in mobile, TD Cowen believes Netflix's “broad catalog across multiple genres creates a durable advantage over time.”",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/netflix-target-raised-at-td-cowen-ahead-of-earnings-432SI-3511911
Oil prices slip as concerns over hurricane damage ease,"By Noah Browning
(Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Tuesday after a hurricane that hit a key U.S. oil-producing hub in Texas caused less damage than markets had expected, easing concerns over supply disruption.
Brent futures fell 39 cents or 0.45% to $85.36 a barrel by 1111 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude slipped 44 cents or 0.53% to $81.89.
Although oil refining activity slowed and some production sites were evacuated, major refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast appeared to see minimal impact from Hurricane Beryl, which weakened into a tropical storm after hitting the Texas coast. 
""Early indications suggest that most energy infrastructure has come through unscathed,"" ING analysts Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey wrote in a client note, adding that price action in crude oil and refined fuel markets reflect little concern on supply disruption from the hurricane.
That eased market worries about the risk of supply disruption in Texas, where 40% of U.S. crude oil is produced.
Major oil-shipping ports around Corpus Christi, Galveston and Houston had been shut ahead of the storm. The Corpus Christi Ship Channel reopened on Monday and the Port of Houston was projected to resume operations on Tuesday afternoon.
Several key refiners such as Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) were also preparing to restart their refining units. [REF/OUT]
Market participants are also keeping an eye on the situation in the Middle East for more trading cues. Oil prices settled down 1% on Monday amid hopes a possible ceasefire deal in Gaza could reduce worries about global crude supply disruption.
Senior U.S. officials were in Egypt for talks on Monday, but gaps remained between the two sides, the White House said, and Hamas said a new Israeli push into Gaza threatened the potential agreement.
""Crude futures were inching lower early Tuesday after a second consecutive session of losses suggested an overdue pullback from (a) nine-week high,"" said Vandana Hari, founder of oil market analysis provider Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Insights.
Markets were also waiting for the release of key U.S. inflation data, with Federal Reserve Chair Powell set to appear before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday, as investors wagered a slew of soft labour market data has greatly increased the chance of an interest rate cut in September to about 80%.
The ""market will find a sympathetic bid if Powell's comments are indeed friendly to a rate cut and if the U.S. CPI backs such language with a lower reading,"" said John Evans, analyst at oil broker PVM.",https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-prices-little-changed-concerns-about-damage-from-hurricane-ease-3510981
"Nasdaq, S&P 500 set to open higher ahead of Powell testimony","By Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Ankika Biswas
(Reuters) -Wall Street was set to open higher on Tuesday, supported by new gains in semiconductor and megacap technology stocks, as investors awaited comments from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell for clues on the central bank's monetary policy path.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq looked on track to set fresh intraday records after both indexes edged up to close at record highs on Monday, lifted by gains in chip stocks and as the Philadelphia semiconductor index rose to a more than two-week high. 
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares leapt 2.6% in premarket trading, while AI-chip favorite Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology gained 1.6% and 0.6%, respectively. 
Monday marked the 35th time this year the S&P 500 has set a fresh closing record, as sharp gains in AI-linked and other tech shares have kept equity sentiment bright, offsetting the uncertainty around the Fed's rate-cut plans. 
Investors will scrutinize Powell's Congressional testimony later in the day to gauge the central bank's response to recent economic data pointing to a slowdown in the labor market, amid other signs of potential economic weakness.
The testimony, followed by questions from lawmakers, is scheduled to start at 10 a.m. ET. Powell will also testify at a House committee hearing on Wednesday. 
""The ability for Powell to change the thinking of the market has been proved over the last six months as the market shifted from six rate cuts to one, and after the weaker data in the last two weeks, back to two,"" said Bob Savage, head of markets strategy and insights at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK). 
The last set of economic projections from the central bank's policymakers showed an expectation of just one rate cut this year. But markets have stuck to pricing in 50 basis points of easing, seeing a nearly 74% chance for a 25 bps cut at the Fed's September meeting, according to CME's FedWatch. 
Those bets were at under 50% a month ago. 
Meanwhile, rate-sensitive megacap stocks Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) , Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) were up between 0.1% and 0.4%.
""The market is continuing on a bull run and, with the prospects of rate cuts, I believe may continue for a while,"" said WisdomTree senior economist Jeremy Siegel. 
Crucial inflation data is also due this week, including Thursday's consumer price index and the producer price index reading on Friday.
Investors are also awaiting the start of the second-quarter corporate earnings season this week. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) edged 0.2% higher ahead of its results on Thursday. 
Analysts, on average, see S&P 500 companies increasing their aggregate earnings per share by 10.1% in the second quarter, up from an 8.2% increase in the first quarter, according to LSEG I/B/E/S data.

"EV startup Fisker to recall more than 11,000 vehicles in latest setback (June 12)","(Reuters) - (This June 12 story has been corrected to say that the company will recall more than 11,000 vehicles, not 18,000 vehicles, in the headline, and that it is recalling thousands of cars, not more than 18,000 cars, in paragraph 1) 
Fisker (OTC:FSRNQ) said on Wednesday it was recalling thousands of cars in North America and Europe due to faulty software and non-compliance with safety standards, in the latest setback for the cash-strapped electric-vehicle startup.
The Manhattan Beach, California-based company is ""voluntarily recalling"" 11,201 Fisker Oceans in the U.S., Canada, and Europe to fix software issues that may cause the vehicle to enter a safe state protection mode, potentially leading to a loss of motor power.
It is also recalling 6,864 Fisker Oceans in the U.S. as they do not meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) for gauges and telltale icons in the cluster display. It is also recalling 281 of the vehicles in Canada. 
The startup plans to resolve the issues through an over-the-air update to its Ocean OS vehicle software by June 30.
Vehicles that have already updated to the latest version of the software are not affected by the recall action, it said.
Fisker's Ocean SUV, its only model in production currently, is being investigated by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for four safety-related incidents.
The latest probe, announced last month, is looking into complaints about its automatic emergency braking system being activated inadvertently.

Wells Fargo hires Alexandra Barth for leveraged finance unit,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo said on Tuesday it has named Alexandra Barth as the co-head of its leveraged finance business, beefing up the lender's ranks as it looks to expand its investment banking operations.
Wells Fargo has made a string of hires to its corporate and investment banking unit, which provides trading, lending and other markets-focused services. The bank has added over 50 senior bankers and traders since 2020.

"Fisker to recall over 12,000 Ocean vehicles","(This June 28 story has been corrected to say Fisker recalled thousands of cars, not more than 18,000 cars, earlier in the month of June, in paragraph 8)
(Reuters) - Electric-vehicle firm Fisker is recalling more than 12,000 Ocean vehicles to fix an issue where exterior door handles can stick and fail to open, the company said on Friday, marking its third recall this month.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has four open investigations into a variety of issues related to the Ocean SUV that was meant to compete with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s best-selling Model Y crossover.
Once a high-flying EV startup, Fisker filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month after burning through cash in an attempt to ramp up production and deliver its Ocean SUVs.
""A door that fails to open can prevent occupants from exiting in an emergency, increasing the risk of injury,"" the regulator said, adding that the company will replace the faulty door handles free of charge.
Fisker in a notice asked its dealers in the United States, Canada and Europe to stop sales of the Ocean vehicles in inventory and inspect for the issue.
The company said in a statement 8,204 Ocean SUVs in the United States, 513 in Canada and 3,806 in Europe were being recalled, taking the total figure to 12,523 units.
Customers have complained widely on social media platforms of issues regarding the key fob not unlocking the car at times and the door failing to open.
Earlier this month, Fisker recalled thousands of cars in North America and Europe due to faulty software and non-compliance with safety standards.
Fisker is the second automaker by famed car designer Henrik Fisker to file for bankruptcy protection. The first outfit, Fisker Automotive (OTC:FSRNQ), filed for bankruptcy in 2013 after a battery failure in its Karma plug-in hybrid electric vehicle resulted in a recall and substantial associated costs.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/fisker-to-recall-over-12000-ocean-vehicles-june-28-3511860
