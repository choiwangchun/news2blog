"US Senator Rubio told he will not be Trump's running mate, sources say","By Nathan Layne, Alexandra Ulmer and Steve Holland
MILWAUKEE (Reuters) -U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has been told he will not be Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's running mate, four sources told Reuters on Monday.
Advisers to Trump, whose party is expected to formally announce his vice presidential pick later in the day, had viewed Rubio's residency in Florida as a drawback. The U.S. Constitution bans the electors who formally select the president and vice president from voting for both from their home state - and both Trump and Rubio call Florida home.
While Rubio could likely have overcome that hurdle by moving out of state, some advisers were wary media coverage of such a move would be a distraction for the campaign.
Among the top remaining contenders for the vice presidential nomination are Ohio U.S. Senator J.D. Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, several sources have told Reuters in recent days. Still, some close to Trump had not ruled a dark horse contender as of midday Monday.
Rubio's boosters said that as a Latino he could potentially expand Trump's base. The former president is most popular among White Americans, though he has made significant progress among Hispanic Americans in recent years.

"Inflation data boosted confidence, Powell says, as Fed inches toward rate cuts","Investing.com --Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Monday that recent inflation readings had boosted the Fed's confidence on bringing down inflation, suggesting the central bank is moving closer to rate cuts. 
“What increases that confidence in that is more good inflation data, and lately here we have been getting some of that,” Powell said at the Economic Club of Washington D.C.
Data last week showed that the consumer price index, a measure of inflation, fell for the first time in June, marking the dip for the first time in more than four years. The year over year measure of the core PCE price Index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, at 2.6% remains above the Fed's 2% target. 
""The data confirms the point we have been making for some time: inflation is trending lower, will likely be on the soft side in the second half of this year, and because of the fall in inflation, the Fed will be able to cut three times,"" Morgan Stanley said in a recent note.
The Fed chief said he doesn't expect the Fed to wait until inflation reaches the 2% target before cutting rates as waiting too long to cut rates could undermine the economic expansion, Powell said, adding that the hard landing isn't the most likely scenario. 
“The implication of that is that if you wait until inflation gets all the way down to 2%, you’ve probably waited too long, because the tightening that you’re doing, or the level of tightness that you have, is still having effects which will probably drive inflation below 2%,"" Powell said.
The yield on the United States 2-Year Treasury, which is sensitive to Fed monetary policy, traded lower at 4.45% recently.
About 88% of traders expect a rate cut in September, up from 73% a week earlier.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/inflation-data-boosted-confidence-powell-says-as-fed-inches-toward-rate-cuts-3519604
Gavekal sees 'a sizable red wave come November’s vote',"Recent political events in the United States, most notably Joe Biden’s surprisingly poor debate performance and the attempted assassination of Donald Trump on Saturday, strongly indicate a robust Republican showing in November’s US elections, according to Gavekal Research.
Sixteen weeks is a long time in politics, and much can change before November. However, the 2018 stabbing of Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro demonstrated that “assassination attempts swing undecided voters towards the victim in large numbers,” Gavekal noted.
In the US, more than any other democracy, fundraising plays a crucial role. Following Trump’s conviction on May 31 in a New York court, his campaign saw a surge in donations. After the attempted assassination on Saturday, it is expected that contributions to Trump’s campaign will once again flood in, the macro research firm said in the report.
This influx of support is likely to grow, as the assassination attempt has made it more socially acceptable to support Trump. In 2016, many people were hesitant to openly endorse him. This time, high-profile business figures like Elon Musk and Bill Ackman have publicly pledged their support, and the general public is more openly showing their allegiance.
Meanwhile, the Democratic Party is struggling with internal conflicts and concerns about Joe Biden’s ability to handle a rigorous four-month campaign, leading to a decline in donations. With Hollywood stars increasingly withdrawing their support, backing Biden “has clearly lost its cachet,” Gavekal economists said.
""The prevailing mood has changed, and the stage seems set for a sizable red wave come November’s vote,” they added.
On the positive side for risk assets, this suggests more deregulation, a shift away from diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, more merit-based hiring, and fewer environmental constraints—all factors favored by equity markets. However, it remains uncertain if this will be sufficient to drive another increase in broad indexes, Gavekal said.",https://www.investing.com/news/politics/gavekal-sees-a-sizable-red-wave-come-novembers-vote-3519001
"Exclusive-In blow to Biden, Teamsters consider no endorsement in 2024 race","By Trevor Hunnicutt and Jarrett Renshaw
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden is on the brink of failing to win a key labor endorsement as leaders of the 1.3 million-member Teamsters union consider backing no candidate at all in the U.S. presidential race, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters decision has not been finalized and is expected to be made in the coming weeks. 
Not backing Biden, who the union endorsed in 2020, would compound political damage to the Democratic president's reelection bid. 
A Teamsters endorsement for Republican candidate Donald Trump appears unlikely, sources say, but deep internal divisions mean the union may not back any candidate at all. That would mark the first time since 1996, according to news reports.
Since his halting performance in a presidential debate on June 27, Biden has already seen a number of lawmakers and donors ask him to stand aside, worried about his ability to get reelected and to serve another four-year term. Some allies say they believe Saturday's Trump assassination attempt could quiet those calls, but other Democrats doubt that.
Biden's team once viewed the Teamsters endorsement as all but inevitable, and still counts a number of senior leaders there as supporters. But months of deteriorating relations and rising concerns about Biden's political endurance have soured sentiment among some of the leaders at the union, which represents workers in fields ranging from trucking to manufacturing and office work.
""No final decision has been made,"" said Kara Deniz, a spokesperson for the Teamsters, adding that any reporting that suggests an outcome is speculative.
Last week, United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain met with that union's executive board to discuss his concerns over Biden's ability to defeat Trump.
Teamsters President Sean O'Brien will speak at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Monday night but is not yet scheduled to speak at the Democratic convention in August. 
O'Brien reached out simultaneously to the Democratic and Republican national committees to speak at their conventions but only heard back from Republicans, Deniz told Reuters. 
A person familiar with the planning of the Democratic convention said no final decisions had been made about their programming.
""We are building a convention in Chicago that will tell our story to the American people, including the stories of labor and union leaders and workers that President Biden has been delivering for as the most pro-union president in modern history,"" said convention spokesperson Matt Hill.
BIDEN, CLINTON, OBAMA 
The Teamsters, founded in 1903, endorsed Biden in 2020, as well as Democrats Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, though they have sometimes picked Republicans in earlier elections.
The group's frustrations with Biden's team have mounted in recent months. On one key priority, rescuing trucking giant Yellow (OTC:YELLQ) Corp and its 30,000 union jobs from bankruptcy, O'Brien sought and was denied an Oval Office meeting to discuss the issue with Biden, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
Those frustrations were compounded as some Democratic lawmakers and donors have since the debate called for Biden to drop his reelection bid and open the door for another candidate, another person familiar with the union's deliberations said.
Working-class groups helped power Biden's 2020 election victory in closely contested states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Nevada. 
Union groups encourage their members to vote, volunteer and donate to campaigns, and they form a particularly important source of cash and labor for Democratic presidential campaigns.
In return, they expect policies that increase union jobs, wages and make it easier to collectively bargain contracts with employers. Biden's gestures have included a $36 billion bailout of a union pension fund that prevented cuts to the income of over 350,000 Teamsters union workers and retirees.
Across many unions, rank-and-file workers are more divided about Democrats than their leadership, and Trump has actively courted workers' support.
The Teamsters held roundtables with Trump and Biden this year and hosted some 300 local events with workers to gauge their opinions on the race.
Charles Lutvak, a Biden campaign spokesperson, said the campaign had drawn vast union support reflecting Biden's ""record of delivering results for working families while Donald Trump delivers for his wealthy donors and himself.""
He said Biden is ""a champion for working people over greedy corporations – whether they vote for him or not.""
O'Brien has said the union would conduct polling and likely make a decision on an endorsement after the parties' conventions have concluded next month.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusivein-blow-to-biden-teamsters-consider-no-endorsement-in-2024-race-3519645
Column-US Treasury futures positions at extremes: McGeever,"By Jamie McGeever
ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - Investor positioning in U.S. Treasury futures is stretching to extreme - and in some cases, record - levels that are likely to revive concerns about potential liquidity and stability risks in the world's largest and most systemically important bond market. 
The growth in asset managers' ""long"" and leveraged funds' ""short"" positions comes as slowing inflation and cooling economic activity suggest the Fed will begin its interest rate-cutting cycle sooner rather than later.
It's unclear whether these moves are being driven by the so-called ""basis trade"", where leveraged hedge funds arbitrage small price differences between cash Treasuries and futures, a trade funded via the overnight repo market. 
Essentially, funds sell Treasury futures and asset managers are the buyers. Financial authorities and regulators havewarned of the financial stability risks if these funds, some levered up to 70x, are forced to quickly cover their positions.
What is becoming increasingly clear, however, is the U.S. bond market is at an inflection point in terms of Fed policy, while the longer-term fiscal outlook remains highly challenging, to say the least. 
The potential for a price shock or policy misstep cannot be ignored. What if, for example, a sharp deterioration in economic or labor market data prompts the Fed to cut rates cut by 50 basis points in September instead of the anticipated 25 bps?
This is the backdrop to the latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission figures that show asset managers' and leveraged funds' positions are at or close to record levels, especially at the front end of the yield curve.
CFTC data show that asset managers' aggregate long position across two-, five- and ten-year futures was worth a record $1.083 trillion in the week to July 9. That has expanded nearly 30% since March.
Leveraged funds' aggregate short position across the curve now stands at $1.00 trillion, up around 25% from March and nudging last November's record high of $1.01 trillion.
Within that, asset manager longs and leveraged fund shorts in the five-year space are at all-time highs of $373 billion and $321 billion, respectively, while asset managers' long position in two-year futures was a record $477 billion in the week to July 2.
A long position is effectively a wager that an asset will rise in value, and a short position is a bet that its price will fall.
FUNCTIONING SMOOTHLY
Adjusted for duration, smoothing out the overall market's sensitivity to movement in Treasury yields, positions across the curve are at record levels, according to Matt King, founder of financial market research and consultancy firm Satori Insights.
As long as these offsetting positions can be matched off when one side decides to cut them, the market will continue to function smoothly. Historically, market-making broker-dealers would plug any gap, but that role is now being filled by clearing houses. 
The bigger the positions, the bigger the potential hole is created by a rapid reversal. Regulators do not want a repeat of March 2020 when a disorderly unwind of hedge funds' shortpositions triggered severe volatility and illiquidity in theTreasury market. 
Matt King at Satori Insights says that doesn't appear to be on the immediate horizon. He notes that a healthy, liquid market should indeed have a diverse investor base spanning hedge funds and 'real money', long-term and short-term, and value-oriented and momentum-oriented players.
But the size of the positions being accumulated bear monitoring. 
""You can think of this as potentially putting pressure on the pipes, but if everything's being centrally cleared and properly margined - as opposed to needing to go through dealer balance sheets - you may well be able to cope with those volumes,"" King says. 
""The worry comes if you really delve into the weeds of the settlement process and conclude the pipes can't take the strain. But I'm not quite ready to draw that conclusion as things stand,"" he adds.

"Trump Media, gun stocks surge after assassination attempt","By Medha Singh, Noel Randewich
(Reuters) -Crypto stocks, gun stocks and shares of other companies that could benefit from a Donald Trump presidency jumped on Monday after an assassination attempt on the Republican candidate boosted expectations he would win the November election.
Trump's survival after he was shot in the ear during a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday increased his already considerable lead in betting odds over President Joe Biden.
On politics wagering website PredictIt, contracts for a Trump election victory traded at 68 cents, up from 60 cents on Friday, with a potential payout of $1. Contracts for a Biden victory were at 26 cents.
Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, majority-owned by Trump, soared 30%, lifting its stock market value to $7.6 billion, despite revenue comparable to two U.S. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) shops.
Trump Media is the parent company of social media platform Truth Social, and its shares have now surged 129% in 2024 as retail traders bet Trump will win a second term as president. Added: He previously served from 2017 to 2021.
""It's nearly four months to go (until the election) and things can change, but today the markets are betting on Trump being the victor,"" said Ben Laidler, head of equity strategy at Bradesco BBI, adding that Trump Media ""is the tip of the spear and the most sensitive to a Trump victory."" 
Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped 5.2% after billionaire CEO Elon Musk publicly endorsed Trump following the shooting.
Crypto stocks soared, tracking a 10% rally in bitcoin to a two-week high. Trump has presented himself as a champion of cryptocurrency. Crypto exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Global and bitcoin miners Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) jumped over 10% each. 
Long-dated U.S. bond yields rose on expectations that Trump policies would drive up government debt and stoke inflation, while the benchmark S&P 500 edged 0.5% higher, nearing another record high. 
""Most investors are not changing their overall commitment to U.S. equities. After all, the broad stock market rose under the last Trump administration and has risen under the Biden administration as well,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments.
Gun makers and ammunition stocks Smith & Wesson Brands, Sturm Ruger & Company (NYSE:RGR) and Ammo jumped between 7% and 15%. Gun stocks in the past have surged following mass shootings, civil unrest and fears of gun control that have led to people to buy more firearms out of fear that their availability would become limited.
Shares of private prison operators Geo Group (NYSE:GEO) and CoreCivic (NYSE:CXW) each jumped about 8%. Both are potential beneficiaries of a Trump presidency as he has promised to crack down on illegal immigration, which could boost demand for detention centers.
Software developer Phunware, hired by Trump's 2020 presidential re-election campaign to build a phone app, gained 4%, while video-sharing platform Rumble, popular with conservatives, added 13%.
Clean energy stocks slipped as Trump has said he would reverse many of the Biden administration's signature climate policies, including tax incentives, if he wins the election.
The Invesco Solar ETF fell 5.6% and the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (NYSE:XLE) fell 3.7%.
The iShares MSCI China ETF dropped 2%. Investors believe a second Trump presidency could fuel trade tensions between Beijing and the United States. 
U.S. voters view Trump as the better candidate for the economy, according to Reuters/Ipsos polls, even as Biden's White House seeks to benefit from a solid economy with inflation slowing and low unemployment.
""In the absence of any real policy proclamations from Trump, traders are finding themselves having to speculate,"" said Mark Malek, chief investment officer of Siebert Financial Corp.
""A second Trump presidency would mean expansionary economic stimulus in general, lower income taxes, less regulation, and increased tariffs.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trump-media-crypto-stocks-jump-as-odds-of-trump-victory-rise-after-shooting-3518674
Vertex sues US over fertility support program for Casgevy gene editing therapy,"(Reuters) - Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Monday, seeking a court declaration that a fertility support program for patients who are prescribed its gene editing therapy Casgevy does not violate federal anti-kickback laws.
Casgevy is approved for the treatment of two genetic disorders - sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia - in the United States. 
The treatment involves patients receiving high doses of chemotherapy, with infertility being a potential risk.
While fertility preservation methods such as freezing eggs and sperm banking are covered under commercial insurance plans, government-supported plans like Medicaid do not offer coverage. 
Vertex offers financial support for some Casgevy patients who meet certain eligibility criteria.
The Office of Inspector General, named as one of the defendants in the lawsuit, had previously conveyed to the company that its program could violate anti-kickback laws as it ""poses more than a low risk of fraud and abuse to federal health care programs"". 
The OIG and other defendants in the lawsuit - the HHS, Secretary Xavier Becerra and Inspector General Christi Grimm - did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Anti-kickback provisions prohibit ""quid-pro-quo"" transactions, in which remuneration, such as a bribe or kickback, is sought or offered to influence medical decisions. 
Vertex said anti-kickback laws do not prohibit support such as the one its program provides. 
The program ""removes a financial or medical barrier to care and thereby allows patients to receive appropriately prescribed medical treatment,"" the company said in the court filing.

ISS recommends Masimo investors elect activist Politan candidates to board,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Institutional Shareholder Services on Monday recommended that Masimo (NASDAQ:MASI) shareholders elect both director candidates proposed by activist investment firm Politan, arguing change is needed at the medical device maker.
ISS, the proxy advisory firm whose recommendations often influence how investors decide on proposed mergers and who serves on boards, wrote that change is necessary even after Politan won two board seats last year in a vote.
The board will have six members after the July 25 meeting.
Masimo's stock price has fallen 27% in the last 52 weeks and Politan has said it would immediately review strategy, costs and plans for growth if its candidates are elected.
U.S.-based Masimo ""has continued to display a dangerous lack of accountability to shareholders that will require additional board change to rectify,"" the report, seen by Reuters, said.
ISS recommended investors elect Bill Jellison and Darlene Solomon instead of backing Masimo founder and CEO Joe Kiani and Christopher Chavez. Only two board seats will be voted on this year. 
While ISS said Kiani deserves credit for shaping the company into a ""business with an innovative and successful core product"" it wrote that the company was ""operating like a private business, and was disregarding shareholders in the process.""
Politan has offered to reappoint Kiani to the board if he is ousted and has said it is not actively seeking to replace him as CEO.
ISS said Jellison and Solomon are both independent from Kiani and have appropriate experience serving on public company boards and with mergers and acquisitions and business separations. 
ISS' report came on the heels of rival proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis' report, which also recommended voting for both dissident candidates.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/iss-recommends-masimo-investors-elect-activist-politan-candidates-to-board-3519634
Fed's Powell: Latest data 'add somewhat to confidence' inflation is returning to 2%,"By Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday the three U.S. inflation readings over the second quarter of this year do ""add somewhat to confidence"" that the pace of price increases is returning to the Fed's target in a sustainable fashion, remarks that suggest a turn to interest rate cuts may not be far off.
""In the second quarter, actually, we did make some more progress"" on taming inflation, Powell said at an event at the Economic Club of Washington. ""We've had three better readings, and if you average them, that's a pretty good place.""
""What we've said is that we didn't think it would be appropriate to begin to loosen policy until we had greater confidence"" that inflation was returning sustainably to 2%, Powell continued. ""We've been waiting on that. And I would say that we didn't gain any additional confidence in the first quarter, but the three readings in the second quarter, including the one from last week, do add somewhat to confidence.""
Last week, the Labor Department reported that its Consumer Price Index fell in June from the month before, the first month-to-month decline in four years. Coupled with a reading of wholesale inflation a day later, economists now estimate the gauge the Fed uses for its inflation target, due out later this month, will show yearly price increases have eased closer toward 2%. 
Powell's remarks are likely his last until his press conference following the Fed's July 30-31 meeting.
Fed governors Christopher Waller and Adriana Kugler as well as other top Fed officials also speak this week, comments that may further frame the central bank's thinking at a key moment in their deliberations.
Inflation is edging closer to the central bank's target, and policymakers are increasingly concerned about slowing the economy too much and causing the unemployment rate to rise.
Given what policymakers believe to be an increasingly balanced set of risks, they may well use their final comments ahead of this month's meeting to either flag that rate cuts are imminent or explain why recent data still doesn't warrant a turn to easier monetary policy.
The betting among investors has tilted strongly towards the Fed starting rate cuts in September. Changes to the policy statement in July could provide a strong signal of that by updating how inflation is described and assessing how recent data has added to policymakers' confidence that the pandemic-era outbreak of inflation has subsided.
After rapidly lifting interest rates starting in 2022 to combat the worst inflation outbreak since the 1980s, the Fed has left its benchmark policy rate unchanged since last July in a range of 5.25%-to-5.50%.
As Powell spoke financial markets all but abandoned what had been rising bets on a July rate cut. Traders continue to expect a September rate cut followed by additional cuts in November and December, bringing the policy rate down to 4.5%-4.75% by year-end.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/feds-powell-latest-inflation-readings-in-a-pretty-good-place-3519583
Dow rises to new all-time high as Powell gives nod to recent inflation progress,"Investing.com-- The Dow surged to a fresh record Monday on increased bets for a September rate cut as Fed chief Jerome Powell said recent inflation data had added to confidence.   
At 13:57 ET (18:57 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 183 points, or 0.5%, and had earlier hit a record high of 40,351. The S&P 500 climbed 0.3% to fresh a record and the NASDAQ Composite gained 0.3%. 
Recent data has boosted Fed's confidence on inflation, Powell
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Monday that recent inflation readings had boosted the Fed's confidence on bringing down inflation, suggesting the Fed is moving closer to rate cuts. 
the Fed doesn't expect to wait until inflation reaches the 2% target before cutting rates, and the Fed chief acknowledged that recent data inflation data has increased the Fed's confidence that it is making progress in the battle against inflation.  
 “What increases that confidence in that is more good inflation data, and lately here we have been getting some of that,” Powell said at the Economic Club of Washington D.C.
Trump survives assassination attempt to boost election victory odds
Former President, and leading Republican president candidate, Donald Trump, was targeted in an attempted assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. The assailant shot at Trump multiple times, grazing his ear.  
Early responses to the attack seemed to suggest that his chances of winning the 2024 presidential race were improved, which could result in a more hawkish trade policy and looser regulation over issues from climate change to cryptocurrency.
Trump is now set to speak at the 2024 Republican convention in Milwaukee, where he is expected to be officially nominated as the party’s frontrunner for the presidential race.
Following the attack, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) surged 33% in recent trade as Trump's odds of winning the presidential race were boosted after the former president survived an assassination attempt.  
""Early analysis suggests the odds of victory come November have shifted in favor of former President Trump in the aftermath of the attack with some even upping bets on the House shifting in favor of the GOP,"" Stifel said in a Monday note.
